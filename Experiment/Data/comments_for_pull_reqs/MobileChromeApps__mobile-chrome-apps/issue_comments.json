Eventually we hope to be able to determine the app id of an existing desktop Chrome app and use it automatically in the mobile version, but I'm not certain of the feasibility of this.\n\nFor mobile-to-mobile syncing only, any directory name could be used.\n\nDocumentation for this will be added when this is available.\n"

If it's wrong, I would try removing `~/.cordova` and recreating the project.\n\n(I delete that directory all the time; its purpose is to cache packages that might otherwise be downloaded from the internet every time you run cordova, but sometimes it seems to cache a bit too aggressively).\n"

        "body": "There's several layers of startup lag here. The Mobile Chrome Apps wrapper needs time to do its own bootstrap dance, fetching and loading many JS files, loading the app's background page, running it, opening the window, then fetching and loading the `<script>`s from your app. Only then does Angular's bootstrap begin: Angular parses the DOM, then it inserts the binding, and finally you see everything loaded properly.\n\nThere's not really a way around any of that startup lag, unfortunately. A few things I can suggest:\n- Don't fetch Angular from the CDN; use a local copy. Bundling it into the app and fetching from `file:///...` is much faster than hitting the CDN. That will hopefully remove ~100ms from your startup.\n- Use the minifed `angular.min.js`. That goes for all apps all the time, unless you're hacking on Angular itself.\n- Use `ng-cloak` to avoid a visible \"Hello, {{ name }}\" before the page has loaded.\n\nGlad it's working for you! Also, be aware of the fastclick problem on mobile, and use either `angular-touch.min.js` from Angular core or `fastclick.js`. Currently the latter is more reliable.\n"

Maybe I am just lucky or pleasant , but I can not absolutely complain about that .\n\nThe lag is noticeable when the app is running and I simply type something to check the binding .

Both with Android 4.1.2 , the Note 2 with a newer kernel version . \n\nWhat angularjs version and what type of bindings did you used ? And , who knows , what MobileChromeApps version ? And , well ... did you tested also with these devices ?\n"

Is the Note 2's processor underpowered, or were you perhaps running in a low-battery, power-saving mode that would cut the CPU speed?\n\nI've tested in the past mostly on Galaxy Nexus, Nexus 7 (2013), Nexus 10 and HTC One. The Galaxy Nexus is easily the weakest of those, and it performs well with Angular 1.1.3ish.\n"

Slowness seems not affecting other libs like zepto / jquery . \n\nMy experience is too limited and also based on what you are saying this issue does not apply for a wider array of ( different ) tested devices , so I have to find out which combinations are the most likely involved ...\n\nP.S. : the \"A doubt is rising\" in my previous comment was about the fact that this slowness seems to affect Chrome for Android ( and so Chrome Apps ? ) in specific devices , but not absolutely sure .\n\nEdit : that comment was badly phrased , I apologize for such inconvenience .\n"

        "body": "No worries, not offended. I meant with my previous comment to address the speed: I have used Angular a bunch on mobile and have found it definitely slower than desktop, but also much faster than what you're seeing, therefore something is weird about your code/device/browser/environment.\n\nOne very important point, before we go any further, is about the WebView on Android. On all versions of Android prior to 4.4 (KitKat), the WebView is based on the old Android browser, not Chrome for Android. The old WebView is slow, buggy, and doesn't support any of the nice features of Chrome.\n\nThat said, it still runs Angular apps fine, and without the slowness you've been seeing. If I'm reading your comment correctly, you said that you've got similar slowness in Chrome as well as in the mobile Chrome app? If that's true, it suggests that something about the device is the trouble here, since Chrome and the WebView are using different Javascript backends, different renderers, and so on.\n\nWe haven't tested Angular or mobile Chrome apps on all that many different devices. Both are built by Googlers, which means we tend to have Nexus devices (see my list a while ago of devices I've tested Angular with on mobile).\n"

        "body": "Ok , thank you .\n\nImportant : yes , the issue does affects the Mobile Chrome Apps and Chrome as browser . Issue apply to latest version of Chrome - beta and stable - on various Android 4.1.2 flavors . Tested on a couple Samsung Note 2 and Galaxy Tab 2 7.0 . The only common thing between the devices is the Android version - with different kernels - ( and the carrier , if it applies ) .\n\nMy code is very basic .\n- For the Mobile Chrome App I used the code that I found in the www folder of the installation and edited the index adding the code that I [previously linked](https://gist.github.com/learningjs/7796743) .\n\nFor web pages , I also tested very basic code . Between others :\n- the code using angularjs 1.2.3 for the first [egghead.io video](https://egghead.io/lessons/angularjs-binding) is the worst case : the binding acts only if the text input loses focus or typing a space ( if typing a simple string of characters without spaces nothing happens )\n\nSame code is really fast on Firefox and Dolphin .\n- Interesting enough , codes like [this](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OYx4uZ4xsn0) todo app ( angularjs 1.2.1 ) and [joly-sushi](https://github.com/Mparaiso/joly-sushi) ( angularjs 1.0.3 ) are not affected .\n\njoly-sushi does not binds directly from an input text to an output tag , but the filtering for the images is immensely faster than what I see when experiencing the lag .\n\nWrapping things up , maybe is not the case for further investigation , maybe it is : you did not experienced issues with devices of a specific type , I experience issues with devices of another type . The point is : what other people will experience ? Do you have any statistics on the devices used by people who test Mobile Chrome Apps ? They use all the same type of devices ? Etc .\n"

        "body": "Hi there,\n\nThanks for your contribution!\n\n`node_modules` is intentionally checked in.  It eliminates the need for MCA users to worry about npm and gives us control over our dependencies.  Using packaged `node_modules` also speeds up our `mca` script, since it doesn't need to ever run `npm install` (which is fairly slow).\n\nThe relevant commits are [here](https://github.com/MobileChromeApps/mobile-chrome-apps/commit/1d7bd6c80c0606ac72d04ef7f9e347982a6bed80) and [here](https://github.com/MobileChromeApps/mobile-chrome-apps/commit/ca13234a321f7ac48bd55724f8c7cb7ea2d0c68d).\n\nThanks again!  Please let us know if you have any more questions, concerns, or contribution ideas. :)\n"

Although this works, I can't verify that this is a solution.\n\nI'd opened ddms to see if it really was pushing to the first in the adb list (which I believe it is per cordova docs), but I can't fully verify without detaching some devices, which I will shortly (after I play with my app on the connected S4 ;) )\n\n_Edit_: confirmed, pushes to the first device at the top of the `adb devices` list. Always fun to watch logcat on the Nexus Q, especially when it's headless, display an app (watching via androidscreencast).\n"

This `delayed-stream` module is an node dependency of a dependency of a.. of ours and should have been installed automatically when you did `npm install -g cca`.  Perhaps there was a problem with npm that day?\n\nWould you mind trying to `npm uninstall -g cca` and re-installing `npm install -g cca` to see if you have to add that module manually again?\n\nAlso, which platform are you on?\n\nThanks a bunch!\n"

        "body": "The mobile supported chrome app samples are listed in a table at the bottom of the README.md: https://github.com/GoogleChrome/chrome-app-samples#mobile-support\n\nIf any of those apps are not working for you, that is not expected and we would be pleased for you to report the specific samples.  Please also let us know more about your environment.\n\nMore generally -- whenever you see a blank white screen when running a chrome app on mobile via the `cca` tool, it is a sign of startup issues (and typically javascript syntax errors).  It may be a bug in our environment startup code, since we do a bit of magic to simulate the chrome app runtime.  More often it is because the application itself is relying on desktop chrome specific features that do not exist inside the mobile WebView.\n\nThe best way to find & resolve these issues is by attaching a remote web inspector, then restarting the app (while still having the inspector attached), to catch these startup issues in the console.\n\nHere is a quick guide to do that:\n1. Launch the cordova based mobile port of your Chrome App on Android / iOS using the `cca` tool\n2. Attach a remote web inspector to the Android / iOS WebView by following one of these guides:\n   1. Android: https://developers.google.com/chrome-developer-tools/docs/remote-debugging?hl=de\n   2. iOS: http://phonegap-tips.com/articles/debugging-ios-phonegap-apps-with-safaris-web-inspector.html\n3. If your app was stuck at a blank white screen at startup, and the remote inspector console shows no useful error messages, restart the app by manually typing `chrome.runtime.reload()` into the console.\n4. Hopefully you will now see insightful error messages in the logs to help track down the startup issue.\n5. Please, report back to us if the error was our fault!\n\nBest of Luck.\n"

Preparing to write up a G+ post? ;) We look forward to it.\n\nCCA provides a default stylesheet to try and emulate the desktop chrome app styles:\nhttps://github.com/MobileChromeApps/chrome-cordova/blob/master/plugins/chrome-bootstrap/www/chromeappstyles.css\n\nIt is based on: https://code.google.com/p/chromium/codesearch#chromium/src/chrome/renderer/resources/extensions/platform_app.css\n\nOurs has fallen out of date, so I will update it to the latest version.  Still, it appears that the platform_app.css will not supply a default body height of 100%.  I'll investigate to see where that style is actually coming from on the desktop platform.\n\nNote: we do not attempt to override the default user agent styles to make the webview more like chrome.  There is another issue (#8) already open to provide a default css reset, so clearly this is something users want.\n"

        "body": "@kzahel `cca build`, `cca run`, and `cca emulate` will all first run `cca prepare`, so let me explain more or less what that does..\n1. First, parses your app `manifest.json` to see if your app name, permissions etc have changed, and then automatically add/remove plugins and update cordova's `config.xml` accordingly.\n2. \"assemble\" your web assets.  Takes the contents of your app's `www/` together with the _web assets only_ of your installed plugins, and merged them into the platforms.  Note: We do not update the native components of the plugins during this step (this may change, there is a feature request for this).\n3. Finally, we replace your app's various i18n text, application icons, version codes, etc.\n\nSo yes, we _do_ \"clobber\" the web assets in platform/ on each prepare, which is why we do not advise making edits directly inside that folder.\n\nHowever, for native plugin code, we should _not_ be clobbering files on prepare.  For this reason, I am quite surprised to hear that the changes were reset to a java file during a `cca build` step.  This is either a bug, or perhaps confusion about which files are used when.  There are actually multiple copies of any plugin native file:\n1. `mobile-chrome-apps/chrome-cordova/plugins/...` (`cca` installs plugins from here during project creation time, or if you add permissions to your manifest)\n2. `YourProject/plugins/...` (This is a local cache, mostly useless at the moment)\n3. `YourProject/platforms/android/src/...` (Android plugins loaded at runtime)\n4. `YourProject/platforms/ios/YourAppName/Plugins/...` (iOS plugins loaded at runtime)\n\nMaking edits directly inside platforms/ (points 3 or 4 above) is actually currently the best way to iterate on changes to native code.  This is not usually something a chrome app for mobile developer should have to do -- thats a cordova developer workflow and our team tried to take that pain away best we could.  Any changes you make to these files are local your your project, and you will need to migrate back to the chrome-cordova/plugins repo if you would like to supply pull requests (please do!).\n\nSo, my hypothesis about what happened to your file is:\n(a) We have a bug, or \n(b) Your edits are still around in one of the _other_ copies, or\n(c) You edited the plugin inside `mobile-chrome-apps/chrome-cordova/plugins`, then ran `cca init` (which `cca build` will prompt you to do if there are upstream changes), which switched away from a local git branch you had.\n"

I'll raise the issue with chrome apps team to see if its a docs bug -- but I suspect that chrome is just still supporting the old syntax and the team wants new devs to use the new syntax.\n\nWe can look into adding support for it too, thanks!\n"

No one is looking into this at the moment.\n\nFor one thing, even though it uses the chrome.cast.\\* namespace, its not actually a chrome apps api.\n\nFor another, based on my reading the cast sdk has to run specifically inside the chrome browser, which as you know is not what cordova runs on.  Its possible a subset of the sdk requires no browser features at all (and works already by just including the js in your app), or can be polyfilled, but this is not something we hope to investigate at the moment.\n\nHaving said that, almost everyone on our team is using chromecast on a daily basis and we are huge fans!  I would not be surprised if one of us just hacks something together out of curiosity some day.  Let us know if you do before we do!\n"

A few answers here: \n- cordova.js lives at `android_asset/www/cordova.js`\n- `chrome-extension://` URLs map to `android_asset/www`, so you could get at cordova.js via src=\"/cordova.js\"\n- cordova.js is loaded, and deviceready is fired before your background JS is run. You can detect if you're in the mobile context by checking for the existence of `window.cordova`\n"

It also works fine whilst the app is in the background (minimized - visible in the multitasking page). It is only when the app is closed that the notification (or the alarm) is not triggered.  \n\nFor the desktop It works when the app is running but not if it has been closed. I honestly wasn't expecting it to work for desktop since I closed the app - should it?\n\nLet's just make sure we understand each other - it is only when the app is closed - aka swiped away from the multitask pane that this issue occurs. If it is running in the background it's fine and dandy.\n\nHere is the gist of what I'm trying to do:\n\n``` javascript\nchrome.alarms.onAlarm.addListener(function( alarm ){\n    chrome.notifications.create('randomId', {\n      type: \"basic\",\n      title: \"Guest Due\",\n      message: \"Hey, looks like guest is due back.\",\n      iconUrl: \"/img/image-128.png\"\n    }, function(){ console.log('Notification created!'); });\n});\n\n// trigger alarm in 5s\nchrome.alarms.create('randomId', {when: 5*1000 + Date.now()});\n```\n\nHope this helps\n"

I'll make sure we take a deep look at that document tomorrow to make sure its still accurate, but I think you can get a general idea.\n\nFinally, on Android what happens when you click the app icon from the desktop depends on the `android:launchMode` set in the `platforms/android/AndroidManifest.xml` file -- as described here: #97.\n"

You should be able to change most settings after the fact at any time.\n\nThis may mean supporting flags in `manifest.mobile.json`, or documenting the cordova `config.xml` preference values, and making sure we automatical import old settings when you use `cca create` with `--link-to` or `--copy-from`.\n\nGiven that, I hope we don't need to add CLI flags (which are hard to discover).\n"

        "body": "Hi @wernight.  This is a known issue.  Specifically, you are using `--link-to=` with a source path that is a parent of the the target path.  This causes a symbolic link loop!\n\nIn your example, you would have, `MyProject/www/.cca/www/ -> MyProject/www/` so `MyProject/www/.cca/www/.cca/www/` and `MyProject/www/.cca/www/.cca/www/.cca/www/` (and so on) would all be valid paths!  This causes issues with the way we do `cca prepare` since we cannot know when to stop copying files.\n\nWe have a fix in the pipeline to give you a more useful error message during `cca create` when you try to do this (hopefully that will make it less confusing), but you should not expect to see this work any time soon.\n\nIts possible we will resolve the issue some day, (by not relying on a filesystem symlink), since I think your use case of trying to turn an chrome app into a cca project \"in place\", especially in a hidden folder, is a very valid use case.\n\nFor now, I would resolve the issue by just creating your cca project as a sibling of your chrome app:\n\n```\ncd MyProject\ncca create MyProjectCCA --link-to=./www/\n```\n\nOr alternatively, by create a default cca project, then manually overwriting the `www/` \"in place\", not using `--link-to` at all:\n\n```\ncca create MyProject\ncd MyProject\nrm -rf www/\ngit clone REPO.git www/\ncca prepare\n```\n\nSound Good?\n"

However, I suspect what you are trying to do is prompt to user for where they would like to save the file?  If so, I think you may actually want to use the [`chrome.fileSystem.chooseEntry`](https://developer.chrome.com/apps/fileSystem#method-chooseEntry) -- but sadly our implementation on mobile is not up to par just yet.  I've filed #108 to track this.\n\nSecond question: you do not need to add cordova.js yourself, we do that for you if you use `cca`.\n"

        "body": "From discussions today: We should consider how this interacts with version control.  For a chrome app developer who has a git repo with manifest.json at the root, adding these assets at the root will be quite cumbersome.\n\nAdditionally, even if we do support importing all these assets, we should make sure that all of them are links.\n\nPerhaps a better way to solve this problem is (a) to continue to make everything outside of www/ a build artifact, so you only need to version your chrome app (aka www/), or (b) make it feasible to version control your entire project platforms and all, perhaps by providing a default `.gitignore` that helps you avoid checking in the bits that aren't useful to share.\n"

        "body": "The answer is to change `src/cca.js` `parseManifest` implementation.  However, there's a comment in there that claims to be doing the exact opposite of what I think we want:\n\n```\n          // Check for wildcard path scenario: <scheme>://<host>/ should translate to <scheme>://<host>/*\n```\n\nEither thats just a glaring bug, or there was a reason that isn't obvious to me right now.  Since I'm not confident trying to update this without writing manual tests for each of the cases, I'm going to add this to our task list, likely to be addressed next week.\n\n@bergie you can work around this issue for now by adding the cordova `<access>` tags yourself to the _final_ `config.xml`'s inside the respective `platforms/` folders.  This is a pain as those will be overwritten on `cca prepare`, but at least gives you an option to play.  Alternatively, just work with the `<all_urls>` permission until we resolve the bug.\n"

If you add a `config.xml` inside the `www/` it will not be used[1].\n2. then we run `cordova prepare` which takes the application `config.xml`, and platform `defaults.xml`, and generates the final platform `config.xml` inside `platforms/`, overwriting what was there before (super confusing we know: platform and application `config.xml` have same name, look similar, but are actually different).\n\nSo, if you make edits to the `config.xml`'s inside `platforms/` those edits will be overwritten with each prepare, and commands like `build` automatically run `prepare`[2] so thats why you saw that happening.\n\nI think the answer is simply: edit the `manifest.json` for whatever you can (aka, whitelist, name, description, version, icons, etc), and edit the _top level_ application `config.xml` for whatever cordova specific settings you want.\n\nLet me know if that works.\n\n[1]: cordova-cli supports both config inside and outside `www/`, and while `cca` only supports outside, its possible we have a bug..\n[2]: There are ways to edit those files if you really need, such as in post-prepare hooks, or by circumventing the CLI entirely and using the native build/run scripts, ask how if you really need this.\n"

It's not really intended for mimicking logout functionality.)\n\nAre you seeing this in multiple calls to getAuthToken in the same run of the app?

If I can run one command to get everything setup and a second to push the app to device that, to me, is the best solution. You have this now, it just sets things up with an app name that doesn't make sense for me.\n\nIf I have to go edit files and run extra commands to get things named differently it's a slight barrier to entry and, after a few of them, I'm going to give up as 'not polished'.\n\nI haven't used the link-to or copy-from as I don't have existing chrome apps. I'm using mobile chrome as a simple way to get _started_ doing mobile development. So, it's possible that I don't fit as your target developer audience, but hopefully moving forward you'll start getting more people who want to use mobile chrome as the starting point and making that as simple as possible would be beneficial.\n"

        "body": "Alright.  I think you've convinced me :)\n\nWe are seeing more and more that the ability to port desktop apps (our original target) is less important than the desire to just start from scratch on a mobile hybrid app.  For that reason, I do think we need to have a different, special workflow, to get you up and running from scratch without learning a bunch of details.\n\nI should also add, though, that a lot of our \"out of the box\" workflow effort recently has been focused on [Spark IDE](https://github.com/dart-lang/spark) with [Chrome App Developer Tool for Mobile (aka App Harness)](https://github.com/MobileChromeApps/harness/releases).  The Spark IDE is quite nascent, but it does provide the ability to start with a project boilerplate and specify app name upfront etc as you suggest.\n"

Since the webview is stuck at chrome version 30, we will need to wait for a new android platform update, but in the mean time the cordova team is already looking at just bundling a newer chrome \"webview\" along with cordova-android applications.\n\nFor these reasons, I would probably advise: it would be super useful to work on polyfills for iOS (since its unclear if the next rev of webview will support it), but for Android lets just work on bundling in the latest version of chrome.\n"

Since then, there is a new&better rev of the socket api called [`chrome.sockets`](http://developer.chrome.com/apps/api_index) (note the plural).  We will likely be doing a re-write with evented I/O etc.\n"

        "body": "Just wanted to chime in: the benefits of the new API make a lot more sense on desktop, where the lifetime of the chrome runtime outlives the lifetime of your applications.\n\nThe v2 structure of `chrome.sockets` was supposed to address two problems (at least):\n1. Support killing an idle app while still persisting its running server socket waiting for incoming network connections.\n2. Support iterating the list of existing sockets.\n\nBasically, the v1 structure was a pain to manage resource/app lifetime.  For mobile chrome apps on cordova, where the runtime lifetime is your app lifetime, and your app is the only app, the v2 structure I think buys us little benefit aside from desktop parity and perhaps preference for api structure.\n\nIts absolutely on our radar to implement these new apis (and we would be happy to accept submissions), but it isn't on our task list for the coming weeks because of other more pressing issues (like APIs that don't exist at all, and workflow bugs).  Sorry for the unsatisfying answer.\n"

        "body": "Looking over old design docs (sorry, they seem internal only, but I'll ask if they can be shared publicly, there is no reason to not be) another motivation was to more prominently split the tcp/udp interfaces, since both behaved subtly different and had a different api surface area, and the only way to differentiate was with the options which they were created.  Looks like tcpServer was thrown into that in the end as well, which is great in my opinion.\n\nI do think they did not need to change the API so radically, but they needed to change it at least a little and I guess they decided to fix other API lessons-learned while they were at it.\n"

Now I have to figure out why the in-app payment testing doesn't work as expected and my wife's account gets charged :-)\n\nIn case someone else faces the same problems, here's a step-by-step instruction:\n\nA. Install the cc.fovea.plugins.inapppurchase plugin (currently it's not in Cordova's registry, and google.payments` plugin.xml references it as if it was in fact registered).\n\n```\ncordova plugin add git://github.com/j3k0/PhoneGap-InAppPurchase-iOS.git\n```\n\nB. Install google.payments plugin.  Currently it's not registered and it resides in a subdirectory of a https://github.com/MobileChromeApps/mobile-chrome-apps repo.  I didn't know any better solution than to simply clone the whole repo, copy this plugin's directory elsewhere and make it a separate repo.  I pushed it to https://github.com/muszek/google.payments .  It's 100% the same code as the original, but please do yourself a favor and make sure that's the case.  It's payments after all and you shouldn't rely on some random guy's word.  Hopefully it will be registered soon and you won't have to do it.\nThis is how you install it:\n\n```\ncordova plugin add https://github.com/muszek/google.payments.git\n```\n\nC. Install org.chromium.common plugin\n\n```\ncordova plugin add org.chromium.common\n```\n"

There's no issue with a wrong account being charged (I had to use her account because for some reason Google Play doesn't allow to make a purchase with app's owner account).  There's an issue with the actual charges being made, because I've made everything I was asked to in order to set up a test account and the account shouldn't have been charged at all.  But it probably doesn't have anything to do with your code, so I'm not bugging you with it... I just mentioned it.\n\nC.  Here's something I'd like to bug you with: I played around with the code (Android for now, haven't tested this plugin on iOS at all yet) for a while and I can't get anything but the .buy() method to work.\n\n.getPurchases() fails with an \"Invalid action\" message:\n\n```\ngoogle.payments.inapp.getPurchases(\n    function(resp) {\n        console.log('it worked!');\n        console.log(resp);\n    },\n    function(resp) {\n        console.log('it failed!');\n        console.log(resp);\n    }\n);\nit failed!\nInvalid action\n```\n\n.getSKU():\n\n```\ngoogle.payments.inapp.getSkuDetails(\n    ['ad_removal_2', 'testowy.za.dwa'],\n    function(resp) {\n        console.log('it worked!');\n        console.log(resp);\n    },\n    function(resp) {\n        console.log('it failed!');\n        console.log(resp);\n    }\n);\nundefined\nit failed!\nError retrieving SKU details\n```\n\nIs there a reference implementation of this plugin?  Or perhaps someone would like to test-drive it on my app?  I don't know if it's buggy (you've said it's experimental) or there's a problem with my code or the way things are set up in Google Play.\n"

Thumbs up, really loved that. \n\n@gauntface would you think that is a good idea to handle app names with grunt? as part of the build? \n\nWhat I had in mind before that tut is to kickstart everything from a yo generator instead, having as first class citizen the html5 app and not the cordova app but your approach looks more flexy regarding the yeoman app generator preference. What do you say?\n"

        "body": "@grahamkennery sweet progress.  You can automate the library loading.  See [chrome.identity plugin.xml](https://github.com/MobileChromeApps/mobile-chrome-apps/blob/master/chrome-cordova/plugins/chrome.identity/plugin.xml) on how it depends on a [play services _cordova plugin_](https://github.com/MobileChromeApps/google-play-services).  That plugin in turn uses `<source-file/>` tag to add the `google-play-services.jar` and sets up your `AndroidManifest.xml` automatically. \n\nAlso, [chrome.notifications](https://github.com/MobileChromeApps/mobile-chrome-apps/blob/master/chrome-cordova/plugins/chrome.notifications/plugin.xml) depend on [android.support.v4](https://github.com/MobileChromeApps/cordova-plugin-android-support-v4), etc, etc.\n\nSo, my direct suggestion:\n1. depend on the plugin for play services we already published to plugins.cordova.io using the `<dependancy>` line from `chrome.identity`.\n2. Create a new plugin for chromecast sdk jar (or, perhaps we should host that here?)\n3. add a dependency for (2)\n4. Repeat for any other libs you require\n\nThe specific reason for creating a plugin for each external lib instead of just bundling it with your plugin directly is that if multiple plugins depend on e.g. play services there would be conflicts if they all bundled directly.\n"

        "body": "I should add one more step, the way `<dependancy>` works is: you can depend on an absolute path, e.g. a git repo, local path, etc, or a plugin id.\n\nIf you use a plugin id, it will first search your local `searchpath`'s which you can specify in cordova config, or better yet via CLI: `cca plugin add foo.bar.baz --searchpath=root_folder_containing_plugins`.\n\nSo, what I suggest is that even before you publish your library plugins, `<depend>` on them by ID and add them from local path by using `--searchpath`.\n\nAm I making sense?  Typing in haste before a meeting!\n"

User ran yo cordova\n2.) Generator loads Cordova CLI\n3.) Generator asks user for app name, pkg name etc.\n4.) Generator uses Cordova CLI as a module and creates new project\n5.) Generator asks user about platforms and plugins required, then installs them (Using Plugman module if I recall correctly)\n6.) Run yo webapp and output is handled by the user and pass in a parameter into generator-webapp to make it feel like the same generator\n\nFor the cca generator, we could add the shell script into hooks directory as part of the template and everything should be good to go.\n"

A few quick tests to see if this is working:\n1. Close the chrome app, then see if it automatically re-opens and moves into the list of activities after you send a gcm message (i.e is the app in the app switcher list)?  If not, either the gcm message did not arrive at all or our plugin is misbehaving.\n2. If the app is in the switcher, then open remote web inspector to see if console messages are being printed to know if the webview background scripts are loading.\n3. If they are, add a console.log() to `chrome.gcm.onMessage` outside of the ajax call to see if that fires.\n\nI would absolutely start by confirming you are actually receiving the gcm message.\n"

On the other hand, explicit `git add platforms` gives a nice error about being in gitignore, and `.gitignore` itself is listed in `git status` after initial init/add which should be clear to devs what's going on.\n\nSO, I think just placing a .gitignore inside the default app will be quite valuable to devs, though we should document as well.\n"

I notice it does yield an email address, but I don't think that's the best approach.\n\nDoes using the `userinfo` endpoint I suggested work for you?\n\nIt is odd that you are seeing one scope in the permission request dialog but not the other.  Using the `email` scope, I get asked permission to \"know who you are on Google\".  Are you seeing one scope but not the other every time?

It looks like it will solve the issue.\n\n> Thanks for the heads up on getAccounts. This appears to be a new addition to the API.

If I understand correctly the api will return an account unique id and not the user's email address?\n\nhttps://developer.chrome.com/apps/identity#type-AccountInfo\n\nIf I may give some feedback on the current api. It would be nice to get the user's email address in a consistent api across platforms. The current workaround for us is to call `googleapis.com/oauth2/v3/userinfo` via an HTTP request to get the email address, which seems a bit redundant. I also have to add the `email` oauth2 scope in the manifest.json, which requests access to the users Google+ Account and other personal information I don't really need. This could alarms users and prevent them from continuing in the authentication process in our app, since it's requesting a lot of information :/\n\nThanks again for the quick support!\n"

In other words, instead of issuing all the writes and reads in two subsequent loops, try chaining the completion handlers.\n\nIn practice, however, I'm surprised that this does not work, since the calls should end up being processed in order, and the storage calls are not asynchronously implemented (thats what the thread warning is about).\n\nI'll take a look, this is concerning!

The get being executed well after the set had been confirmed. \n\nThe modelling abstraction I'm using to fetch from and set data to chrome.storage.local (handles localStorage as well for use in regular webapp) encapsulates the calls with promises. But many models in the app uses it to store their data separately causing a cascade of read and writes especially in the start of the app. \n\nI'll have to figure out a good way to queue up all those calls and execute them in a chain for now.\n"

It is fixed for the next version of `cca`.\n\nIn the meantime, you can stick with your current workaround, or you can manually install the new version of the Google Play Services plugin as follows:\n\n```\ncca plugin rm org.chromium.identity\ncca plugin add https://github.com/MobileChromeApps/google-play-services.git\ncca plugin add org.chromium.identity\n```\n\nYou cannot simply remove the existing Google Play Services plugin and add the updated one, since that's forbidden due to dependencies.  So we remove identity first.\n\nThanks for reporting this!  Please re-open if you have any further problems (eg. if this persists with cca 0.1.1).\n"

Basically it means all cca android apps will use a single custom webview, currently based on Chrome 36!\n\nWe expect the file size to be cut down at least 2x once we split arm from x86 builds, and possibly more once we optimize the builds a bit.  However, there will continue to be an overhead, since we consider the tradeoff worthwhile considering the features this webview brings (WebGL, WebRTC, Web Audio, the latest web platform features to run Polymer without polyfills, etc), as well as giving you a single stable target to develop against even as far back as Android 4.0!\n\nIf you _really_ do not want to use the crosswalk webview, you can add this line to your `manifest.mobile.json`:\n\n```\n'webview': 'system'\n```\n\nGood luck (I'll address the RELEASE NOTES question in #197)\n"

Specifically it's this line:\n\nhttps://github.com/apache/cordova-js/blob/70cdca3055a6631ab368ce6ef1770695e2eb5130/src/android/exec.js#L188\n\nI could just allow `'unsafe-eval'` but that is not such a good idea, since using eval is such a big attack surface. Perhaps you could patch cordova.js to use something other than eval?\n"

Glad you figured it out.\n\nWe've been asked on guidance on which files should be added to git, and we added a default `.gitignore` file for new projects now.  (Not sure which version of `cca` that was added).\n\n`hooks` folder is technically a part of your application and should be managed by git.  However, the hooks you refer to were created by the `cca` tool, and so we would prefer if you didn't have to manage those (nor accidentally remove them).  I'll file an issue to move those hooks over to plugin hooks as soon as we add support for it in cordova-cli.  That way, `cca` apps won't create a `hooks` folder at all by default.\n"

The other values change in a way that I would expect when swapping x/y axis.  I'm not sure whats correct here.  I know we are just forwarding what android presents us.  On osx, chrome just reports 0, so I don't think we should address this (except perhaps to report issue with android DisplayMetrics?).\n"

And now we are fairly boldly betting on crosswalk which is also ICS+.\n\nAlso, cordova android does support 2.3, but that doesn't mean everything that works on 4.x works there, and it is greatly underemphasized.\n\nChrome Apps for Mobile provides a few things that cordova does not, but mostly we aren't trying to be radically different or better (most of our contributions are directly to cordova).  We just want to make hybrid awesome, and using chrome apps as a motivating target implementation.\n\nSome of the differences with cordova are [listed in our faq](https://github.com/MobileChromeApps/mobile-chrome-apps/blob/master/docs/faq.md#why-use-cca-rather-than-cordova).\n"

That is, if multiple writes are issued closed together, they can conflict such that changes are overwritten (i.e. last write wins).  For writes, the chrome.storage implementation reads in the existing storage first, so the problem is really stale reads, as opposed to write calls being processed out of order.\n\nA fix is currently under review (see pull request #298).\n"

        "body": "Sadly, we do not maintain a list of cca-powered apps.\n\nRegarding your question about limiting remote updates: I believe I'm hearing that you hope to just download the remote asset once on first launch (or perhaps first login), but then cache locally & permanently.  I'm not sure that such a scheme is any less a breach of the rule you cite than a solution which loads remote resources each time (Though of course local caching has many other benefits).  I think Apple would like all assets to be bundled and available at app review time.\n\nThat said, very many cordova/cca apps have implemented remote updates and successfully passed app review.  Perhaps its just hit & miss, but Apple is more open than the wording of the guidelines suggests.  I think the spirit of the rule was meant to prevent applications from significantly changing their own behaviour, to the extent of surprising the user, or leading to poor experience.  In other words, you cannot ship a \"web browser\" which loads arbitrary apps within a shell.  You probably also want to have a solution to the offline/slow internet use case, even on first launch.  But many app developers do update web assets to fix bugs or add small features.\n\nOne specific example of a team that did this, [and wrote up a great report on it](http://phonegap.com/blog/2013/04/23/story-behind-exfm/), is exfm.  That team used `phonegap`, not `cca`, but the same issues apply.  Their specific conclusions and recommendations may not be the best solution for you, but it should hopefully give you some insight!\n"

        "body": "I haven't seen any issues with the installed APKs. But during build process there were issues with plugins that have capital letters in their ID, but you already worked around those problems. Most of the chrome plugins were installed from a local directory until recently. But then we moved them to the registry. The registry doesn't take upper case for IDs so all references inside CCA were changed to lower case, but the plugins themselves can sometimes still have upper case IDs in their plugin.xml (which works ok except when it was a dependency ID). I think it was solved recently but not yet published. Anyway, the repeated re-installation of those plugins didn't affect execution as far as I know.\n\nOne thing I would suggest to try, is use the cca version from git. In that case the plugins will be installed from the local copy as they did before. Please tell us if this helps.\n"

It looks like they are mixed-case in the plugin.xml file, and that may be causing problems.\n\nI don't think that it's CADT-related; everything is working there, and the audio/videoCapture plugins are baked into the CADT APK in any case.\n\nFor the audio and video capture plugins to work, you should have the strings `\"audioCapture\"` and `\"videoCapture\"` in your permissions list. If those are there, then after prepare, you should see two directories in your `plugins` directory: `org.chromium.audioCapture` and `org.chromium.videoCapture`. Those directories should only have three files each in them.\n\nIf those are there, then the next thing you should look at is your `AndroidManifest.xml` file, in `platforms/android`. If the plugins were installed correctly, then there should see these lines (possibly not in this order, or even all together):\n\n```\n<uses-permission android:name=\"android.permission.RECORD_AUDIO\" />\n<uses-feature android:name=\"android.hardware.camera\" />\n<uses-feature android:name=\"android.hardware.camera.autofocus\" />\n<uses-permission android:name=\"android.permission.CAMERA\" />\n```\n\nIf those lines are all there, then the webrtc features should be working correctly.

This is the only showstopper for moving Whiteout from Alpha to Beta. Other than that cca has gotten much better :+1: \n\nThanks\n"

That is, there is explicit logic to put/keep the app in the background when a notification is closed, but that does not apply when a notification is clicked.\n\nIn testing with a desktop Chrome app, the app is not shown/given focus when clicking on a notification (or a button within).  If the app window is minimized or hidden, it will receive the event for the notification/button click, but the window state is not changed.\n\nThus, it would seem that the current behaviour on mobile should be changed, as originally described.  The question is what to do about existing apps that might be relying on the \"incorrect\" behaviour.  Do we just handle this via education/documentation?  For example, release notes indicate that issues 323 and 352 have been implemented, change your notification callbacks to use AppWindow.show()/restore() as needed.\n"

If you `setPaused` before sending STARTTLS, the pending read will be handled. For example, \n\n```\nfunction trySTARTTLS() {\n  var receiveCounter = 0;\n  var startTLSReceiver = function(info) {\n    receiveCounter++;\n\n    if (receiveCounter == 2) {\n      chrome.sockets.tcp.setPaused(info.socketId, true);\n      chrome.sockets.tcp.send(info.socketId, stringToArrayBuffer('STARTTLS\\r\\n'), function(result) {\n      });\n    } else if (receiveCounter == 3) { // Ready To Start STL Response\n      chrome.sockets.tcp.secure(info.socketId, {tlsVersion: {min: 'ssl3', max: 'tls1.2'}}, function(result) {\n        logger('secure result: ' + result);\n      });\n    }\n  }\n  var addr = 'smtp.gmail.com';\n  var port = 25;\n  chrome.sockets.tcp.onReceive.addListener(startTLSReceiver);\n  chrome.sockets.tcp.create(function(createInfo) {\n    chrome.sockets.tcp.connect(createInfo.socketId, addr, port, function(result) {\n      chrome.sockets.tcp.send(createInfo.socketId, stringToArrayBuffer('HELO me.com\\r\\n'), function(result) {\n      });\n    });\n  });\n}\n```\n\nI have tested this on `Google Chrome    39.0.2171.27 (Official Build) beta`. This won't work on iOS for now, since the plugin won't send received data after paused.\n"

        "body": "@mmocny There's docs about `manifest.json` and `manifest.mobile.json`? I'm not sure about what these files can do in my app, for example, cordova preferences tags, I can directly set on config.xml or it may be set in manifest.json and it will be reflected in my config.xml during the build? (because if my config.xml is auto-generated i should ignore it on GIT) This [extensions/manifest](https://developer.chrome.com/extensions/manifest) is not about this cordova thing, and [Crosswalk docs](https://crosswalk-project.org/documentation/manifest/using_the_manifest.html) seems to be not exactly what a doc means to be.\n\nMy cordova plugins, I can set it in the `manifest.mobile.json`? Or I need to install individually? Because when I run `cca platform add android`, it install all CCA plugins, but not the plugins I'm using, and if I first install my plugins and then I run `cca platform add android`, it will remove my current plugins and install the cca plugins... I'm looking for some docs to read, to feel okay with how cca works and to understand what I'm doing exactly.\n\nSorry for this question in the wrong place, and thank you for the hard work you are doing here.\n"

Doing so takes you out of the world of Chrome App development and into cordova project management (because chrome apps don't have a config.xml).\n\nConfig.xml is not included in the default `.gitignore` we create, and so should very much so be added to your version control _if_ you are actually managing the whole cordova project directory structure and not just the contents of `www`.\n\nThat said, we've had some requests to support changing cordova <preferences> from `manifest.mobile.json` (See #393).\n\nWe should not comment further on this bug, since it is not related to your current question, please continue on #393.\n"

Among many other duplicated symbol warnings, the same as for org.chromium.iossocketscommon appear.\n\nThe bottom line in the error log mentions those errors occur on armv7, so I thought it could be the linker flag.

defined in docs\n\niOS and Android splash screens, are added right, but icons are not.\n\nMy icons in `manifest.json` is only\n\n``` json\n \"144\": \"res/icon/ios/icon-72@2x.png\"\n```\n\nWhen I build on xcode, I click in `submit` and it fails because a 120x120 icon is missing.\n\nSo, I read here (https://github.com/MobileChromeApps/mobile-chrome-apps/issues/399#issuecomment-61206138), that I have to add icons in `manifest.mobile.json`, so, now my file looks like this:\n\n``` json\n{\n  \"packageId\": \"com.company.app\",\n  \"android\": {\n    \"icons\": {\n      \"ldpi\": \"res/icon/android/drawable-ldpi.png\",\n      \"mdpi\": \"res/icon/android/drawable-mdpi.png\",\n      \"hdpi\": \"res/icon/android/drawable-hdpi.png\",\n      \"xhdpi\": \"res/icon/android/drawable-xhdpi.png\"\n    }\n  },\n  \"ios\": {\n    \"icons\": {\n      \"60\": \"res/icon/ios/icon-60.png\",\n      \"120\": \"res/icon/ios/icon-60@2x.png\",\n      \"76\": \"res/icon/ios/icon-76.png\",\n      \"152\": \"res/icon/ios/icon-76@2x.png\",\n      \"40\": \"res/icon/ios/icon-40.png\",\n      \"80\": \"res/icon/ios/icon-40@2x.png\",\n      \"57\": \"res/icon/ios/icon.png\",\n      \"114\": \"res/icon/ios/icon@2x.png\",\n      \"72\": \"res/icon/ios/icon-72.png\",\n      \"144\": \"res/icon/ios/icon-72@2x.png\",\n      \"29\": \"res/icon/ios/icon-small.png\",\n      \"58\": \"res/icon/ios/icon-small@2x.png\",\n      \"50\": \"res/icon/ios/icon-50.png\",\n      \"100\": \"res/icon/ios/icon-50@2x.png\",\n      \"180\": \"res/icon/ios/icon-60@3x.png\"\n    }\n  },\n}\n```\n\nInside my `platforms/ios/projectName/projectName-info.plist` is missing a call to some files added to `manifest.mobile.json` like 180x180, 120x120, \n\n``` xml\n    <dict>\n        <key>CFBundlePrimaryIcon</key>\n        <dict>\n            <key>CFBundleIconFiles</key>\n            <array>\n                <string>icon-40</string>\n                <string>icon-small</string>\n                <string>icon.png</string>\n                <string>icon@2x</string>\n                <string>icon-72</string>\n                <string>icon-72@2x</string>\n            </array>\n            <key>UIPrerenderedIcon</key>\n            <false/>\n        </dict>\n    </dict>\n```\n\nThere's no call for  `icon-60@2x`, so a added it manually\n\n``` xml\n        <string>icon-60</string>\n        <string>icon-60@2x</string>\n```\n\nAnd now finally, I could send my app to App Store. BTW, I'm using shell script to auto-generate splash screens and icons https://github.com/felquis/generate-splash-screen-and-icons\n"

Perhaps try using the new custom components polyfills supplied by https://github.com/Polymer/webcomponentsjs (as recommended by the warning when including platform.js).\n\nHopefully you can report back with further findings after using the attach-remote-inspector-and-run-`chrome.runtime.reload()` trick to see startup errors.\n"

        "body": "Perhaps Andrew didn't add the plugin at all.  Similar to WebRTC, the javascript endpoints are available in crosswalk, but you have to actually add the correct android permissions to your AndroidManifest in order for them to do anything.  Otherwise they just silently fail (sucks, not sure if we can do anything about that).\n\nIf you add the geolocation plugin `cca plugin add org.apache.cordova.geolocation` it will automatically add the correct permissions, and then geolocation should work.\n\nHowever!  For chrome apps, the correct way to solve this problem is to add the \"geolocation\" permission to your chrome app manifest (as per [this doc](https://developer.chrome.com/apps/declare_permissions)).  Otherwise, `cca prepare` will auto-uninstall the geolocation plugin.\n\nFor chrome apps on desktop, if you don't include the \"geolocation\" permission, you get a warning when you go to use it:\n\n```\nIs the 'geolocation' permission appropriate? See http://developer.chrome.com/apps/declare_permissions.html.\n```\n\nWe could investigate doing something similar.\n"

Any changes to native code will scale best if they are done by creating a plugin.\n\nWhenever edits to `platforms/` cannot be avoided and cannot be implemented with a plugin, another option is to use a [hook](https://github.com/apache/cordova-lib/blob/master/cordova-lib/templates/hooks-README.md) and modify the contents on every prepare.\n\nIf you don't want to bother with plugins and hooks and rather make edits to platforms directly, thats fine, but will make upgrades harder for you to manage.  The CCA upgrades just delete and reinstall platforms.\n"

I'm doing it, and my app is fully loading within three seconds.\" - Nov 6\n\nYou need `<access origin=\"*\"/>` in your `config.xml`\n\n\"In short: no. Unless some material progress has been made on the platform, the instantiation period is not survivable. We were proceeding in a similar fashion, using UIWebView to embed Polymer-based components, but we ended up seeing about a 20-25 second delay while polymer instantiated \u2014 consistently replicable across devices. So, I'd answer \"no\" but your mileage may vary.\" - Oct 15\n"

        "body": "@kristianmandrup Indeed those answers are conflicting and confusing.\n\nFirst, The faq for \"chrome on iOS\" has answers that are mostly applicable to Chrome Apps for Mobile, but not always.  Specifically, Chrome for iOS is as constrained as any other hybrid app on iOS: it has to use UIWebView (or the new WKWebView) for rendering, has to use the regular iOS sdk, has to go through regular app store review...  However, Chrome for iOS does add a bunch of neat chrome stuff, like a custom networking stack & proxy, various identity and sync features, and a bunch of UI/product features (omnibox, voice search, ) etc.  Chrome Apps for Mobile don't leverage those features at all.\n\nSo yes, Chrome Apps for Mobile are bound to use UIWebView (perhaps soon WkWebView) but that is just because of iOS restrictions not because we leverage Chrome for iOS in any way (we do not).\n\nRegarding polymer perf on iOS: Polymer is certainly focusing on working well on iOS.  I've created lightweight applications that run fine on iOS devices.  The 20 second startup times may have applied to older versions of polymer that were striving for maximum compatibility and not maximum performance, and then using many heavyweight components that use all the features.\n\nPolymer team has changed strategies recently in order to address these concerns.  I invite you to watch [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0LT6W5QVCJI) that goes over those details.  It appears as though this upcoming higher-performance version (0.8) is not officially shipped, but you can take a look at whats cooking in the [git repos](https://github.com/polymer), or just wait a bit and trust that perf will improve soon.\n\nNone of this explains why vulcanize isn't working ;)\n"

Perhaps we have different environments?\n\nI just did a bit more experimenting and here are my observations:\n\n1) when running vulcanize without --strip I get blank screen and errors about device ready not fired in web inspector after running chrome.runtime.reload():\n\n![screen shot 2014-12-03 at 7 25 59 am](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1347600/5283164/d0f64b8a-7ac0-11e4-80aa-72a6992344c4.png)\n\n2) HOWEVER, same as above, without --strip, when I run location.reload() in web inspector the app works, including the radio buttons which is the first time I see working in iOS:\n\n![screen shot 2014-12-03 at 7 53 56 am](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1347600/5283294/92456c6c-7ac1-11e4-9a44-08dca924eded.png)\n\n3) When running vulcanize with --csp and --strip, I get an app that loads in emulator right away and shows the UI, but running chrome.runtime.reload() in web inspector shows errors when I click on buttons and radio buttons don't fill in when I click on them:\n\n![screen shot 2014-12-03 at 7 59 54 am](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1347600/5283423/660ab76e-7ac2-11e4-82e6-7fd09bf5f4e8.png)\n\n4) running location.reload() for step 3 above, results in a UI that renders but web inspector still shows same errors and radio buttons still don't work.  Notice that doing the same in step 2 above, when vulcanize didn't include --strip, resulted in an app that ran without errors after location.reload() which is strange:\n\n![screen shot 2014-12-03 at 8 01 47 am](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1347600/5283510/ec2deb68-7ac2-11e4-8999-d30de09e703a.png)\n"

The manifest file is not something our tools currently help you manage by making automatic edits, and this would be a rather insignificant reason to start doing that now.\n"

The other errors are still there, but my fix still seems to work for that.\n\nThe vulcanize issue is blocking me again though.  After upgrading to latest vulcanize version 0.7.2 iOS app is broken with or without --strip.  With --strip it loads my first screen, but pressing on the buttons does not transition to the next screen.  Rebuilding it with vulcanize 0.7.1 works as expected.  In both versions however specifying both --strip and --inline options doesn't work, which is what I would ideally want do to.\n\nThis definitely sounds like a vulcanize issue.  I'll try to isolate it a bit more.\n"

Agreed that the api design is inherently open to races, and that while this change would take a while to test for complete correctness it is no worse than currently written.\n\nFor the future, you can take a look at our [Chrome Apps Api Test Suide](https://github.com/MobileChromeApps/mobile-chrome-apps/tree/master/chrome-cordova/chrome-apps-api-tests) (see the Readme for instructions) test suite to run through bluetooth tests.  Bluetooth is a pain to test, though, since you need various peripherals.  Bluetooth has both an automated portion and a set of manual tests.

They also use the [gcm helper libraries](https://developer.android.com/google/gcm/helper.html) which are apparently deprecated.\n\nWe use [android-support-v4](https://github.com/MobileChromeApps/cordova-plugin-android-support-v4) which is referenced from several of our plugins, and I believe [includes the accessibility service](https://developer.android.com/tools/support-library/features.html#v4).\n\nI wouldn't expect their to be a conflict between the android-support v4 and v13 libraries, but its worth checking, I suspect its something included in the older gcm helper library.  I cannot verify right now, but hopefully that gives you something to investigate.\n\nA few comments:\n- Its sorta bad practice to bundle a popular android lib directly with a plugin (like PushPlugin is doing), since in the long run it's going to cause duplication conflicts.  Instead, android libs should live in their own plugin which can be used as a shared dependency.\n- Did you know we have a `chrome.gcm` plugin?  It only supports android, but works quite well.\n"

The one which starts at our [`README`](https://github.com/MobileChromeApps/mobile-chrome-apps/blob/master/README.md)?\n\nFor a list of available plugins, you can see our [list of supported apis](https://github.com/MobileChromeApps/mobile-chrome-apps/blob/master/docs/APIsAndLibraries.md).\n\nchrome.PushMessaging is deprecated for desktop, you are correct, where Chrome Apps run in the Chrome Browser Runtime, because there is better support for chrome.gcm.  For Mobile, we have a created a cordova plugin that implements the same chrome apps api, but using a very different implementation (it uses iOS's `didReceiveRemoteNotification`).  So this plugin is not really affected by the desktop deprecation, except perhaps that we may not be quite as motivated to work on it in the future.\n"

This change does not copy/preserve the InAppBrowser implementation anywhere.  Instead, CB-8444 has been addressed to provide a uniquely-named API for InAppBrowser as `cordova.InAppBrowser.open`.  See the plugin docs for more details:\nhttps://github.com/apache/cordova-plugin-inappbrowser\n\nThe fix for CB-8444 is not yet released.  Until then, the workaround is to explicitly require the InAppBrowser.  See the chrome.identity plugin as an example.\n"

We already bugged Matt Gaunt from the Chrome Team when he was in Munich (https://twitter.com/tankredhase/status/573243929333776384). It would be great if someone from the CCA team could also drive this issue from your side :/\n\nthanks\n"

Just `plugin add org.apache.cordova.vibration`.  For details, see https://github.com/apache/cordova-plugin-vibration\n\nI would recommend the last option, as it's supported and lets you use the same `navigator.vibrate` API.\n"

So, this issue could be straight-forward to implement, and thus a good place to start.  On the other hand, it could be infeasible or difficult to implement.  It would also depend on your familiarity with mobile payments in general.\n\nIf you're still looking to get your feet wet with Chrome Apps for Mobile, I'd guess there are easier places to start.

If you're not familiar with CORS, see http://www.w3.org/wiki/CORS_Enabled.\n\nIf you've verified the appropriate server configuration, I would suggest using a simple XHR to test connectivity.  I created a basic example that will send a JSON request to the [jsfiddle echo service](http://doc.jsfiddle.net/use/echo.html).\n\nI created a new app, using the latest version of cca (0.6.0-rc1).  I included the code below, and was able to successfully execute an XHR.  Maybe copy this example into your app and see if it works?  If it works, that suggests the problem is specific to the XHR call and/or receiving server.  If it doesn't work, it might provide hints to the problem with the app configuration.\n\n```\nfunction execAPI(requestContents, callback) {\n  var xhr = new XMLHttpRequest();\n  var url = 'http://jsfiddle.net/echo/json/';\n  xhr.open(\"POST\", url, true);\n  xhr.responseType = 'json';\n\n  // completion handler\n  xhr.onload = function() {\n    console.log('Post to ' + url + ' worked: ' + xhr.status + ', ' + xhr.statusText);\n    console.log('Post results: ', (typeof xhr.response) + ' ', xhr.response);\n    callback(xhr.response);\n  };\n\n  // Post the request contents in json format\n  //  - The json= format is specific to getting jsfiddle echo to work\n  xhr.send('json=' + encodeURIComponent(JSON.stringify(requestContents)));\n}\n\n    execAPI(\n      {myTextProperty: 'some text'},\n      function(results) {\n        console.log('Results: ' + (results ?

        "body": "Okay, so I had the same issue with my polymer app. Here is the solution (or at least a good start). First, you need to make the container scrollable. So, if all of your inputs are inside a div which has a 100% width and height you need to add the following properties to it:\n\n``` css\n.scroll {\n  overflow: scroll;\n  position: absolute;\n  width: 100%;\n}\n```\n\nNow, the very least which you will get is that you will be able to scroll the view when the keyboard opens.\n\nAnother step which I will take when I get to it is to use the Ionic's keyboard plugin to manually scroll to the input when the keyboard opens.\n\nI hope this will help, let me know of the results since I am in the process of working through it myself.\n"

        "body": "I've verified the problem on Android, with the latest cca.  When the app is started (and not previously running), the screen will not rotate.  This applies if the app is started from the home screen, recents, as well as `cca run`.  If the app is running (i.e. paused), and then resumed, the screen will rotate as expected.\n\nAs in the stack overflow question (see earlier comment), the problem is related to the use of the \"Translucent\" theme.  Explicitly setting a non-translucent them (e.g. \"Black-NoTitleBar\") will correct the problem, and the screen will rotate as expected.  We don't have a clear explanation or reason for this behaviour.  For example, we haven't identified if this expected vs a bug in Android.\n\nThere is another work-around that allows the translucent theme to be used.  In the AndroidManifest.xml, the activity can be configured to force screen rotation to be detected/respected.  This is done by adding the attribute `android:screenOrientation=\"sensor\"` to the affected `<activity>` element(s).  Unfortunately, if this change is made directly to platforms/android/AndroidManifest.xml, it will be over-written when the app is prepared.  In the short-term, a post-prepare hook is required to update the AndroidManifest.xml.  See below for a sample script for the post-prepare hook.\n\nPlease try one of two workarounds to see if that addresses the problem.  We are investigating a fix, so that a workaround is not needed.\n\nSample post-prepare script (put in an executable file under .../hooks/after_prepare):\n\n```\n#!/usr/bin/env node\n\nvar fs = require('fs');\nvar path = require('path');\n\n// no need to configure below\nvar rootdir = process.argv[2];\n\nvar srcfile = path.join(rootdir, 'myAndroidManifest.xml');\nvar destfile = path.join(rootdir, 'platforms/android/AndroidManifest.xml');\nconsole.log(\"copying \"+srcfile+\" to \"+destfile);\nvar destdir = path.dirname(destfile);\nif (fs.existsSync(srcfile) && fs.existsSync(destdir)) {\n    fs.createReadStream(srcfile).pipe(\n       fs.createWriteStream(destfile));\n}\n```\n"

Let us know if you're still running into problems.  Thanks!\n"

        "body": "I'm having this same bug. When I cca prepare/build ios it doesn't seem to be copying the correct icon sizes to the iOS resources folder (it works fine on Android!). It appears to be taking whatever your last icon in the icon list from manifest.json is and just copying that for every icon size (when I had 152 as the last in the list it made them all 152, now they are all 180). My config.xml says this:\n\n```\n<icon src=\"www/img/icons/icon_180.png\" />\n<icon src=\"www/img/icons/icon_29.png\" width=\"29\" />\n<icon src=\"www/img/icons/icon_36.png\" width=\"36\" />\n<icon src=\"www/img/icons/icon_40.png\" width=\"40\" />\n<icon src=\"www/img/icons/icon_48.png\" width=\"48\" />\n<icon src=\"www/img/icons/icon_57.png\" width=\"57\" />\n<icon src=\"www/img/icons/icon_58.png\" width=\"58\" />\n<icon src=\"www/img/icons/icon_72.png\" width=\"72\" />\n<icon src=\"www/img/icons/icon_76.png\" width=\"76\" />\n<icon src=\"www/img/icons/icon_78.png\" width=\"78\" />\n<icon src=\"www/img/icons/icon_80.png\" width=\"80\" />\n<icon src=\"www/img/icons/icon_87.png\" width=\"87\" />\n<icon src=\"www/img/icons/icon_96.png\" width=\"96\" />\n<icon src=\"www/img/icons/icon_120.png\" width=\"120\" />\n<icon src=\"www/img/icons/icon_152.png\" width=\"152\" />\n<icon src=\"www/img/icons/icon_180.png\" width=\"180\" />\n```\n\nand my manifest.json:\n\n```\n\"icons\": {\n    \"29\": \"img/icons/icon_29.png\",\n    \"36\": \"img/icons/icon_36.png\",\n    \"40\": \"img/icons/icon_40.png\",\n    \"48\": \"img/icons/icon_48.png\",\n    \"57\": \"img/icons/icon_57.png\",\n    \"58\": \"img/icons/icon_58.png\",\n    \"72\": \"img/icons/icon_72.png\",\n    \"76\": \"img/icons/icon_76.png\",\n    \"78\": \"img/icons/icon_78.png\",\n    \"80\": \"img/icons/icon_80.png\",\n    \"87\": \"img/icons/icon_87.png\",\n    \"96\": \"img/icons/icon_96.png\",\n    \"120\": \"img/icons/icon_120.png\",\n    \"152\": \"img/icons/icon_152.png\",\n    \"180\": \"img/icons/icon_180.png\"\n},\n```\n\nA temporary fix is to go into the iOS platform resource folder after preparing and manually resaving everything to the correct size. There's a list of what sizes the names correspond to here:\nhttps://developer.apple.com/library/ios/qa/qa1686/_index.html\n"

It may be infeasible for the general case but it seems like it will work for my use case.\n\nI took it out of the \"STALE\" list in the cca plugins list and compiled. Running on android gave me an error with ChromeStorage. I suspect this version dates prior to the refactor into individual repos on MobileChromeApps and needs some work.\n\nI found the syncFileSystem code back on Feb 10 in this repo: https://github.com/MobileChromeApps/mobile-chrome-apps/tree/master/chrome-cordova/plugins/chrome.syncFileSystem. Supposedly it was moved on Feb 11 into it's own repo.\n\nWould you be willing/able to provide the source (let me branch) from _after_ the migration to its own repo? It would give me a starting point that presumably is further along than the Feb 10 version.\n\nThanks so much.\n\nDave\n"

        "body": "Hi, I recently transitioned my app from cca to plain jane cordova. In the repo commit where the README was changed, there was a comment basically saying most of what cca was trying to do is now available in cordova. Transitioning wasn't actually as hard as I was afraid it was going to be. I didn't to the best job documenting, but here's the gotchas I remember running into:\n\nInstead of trying to migrate the app in-place, I made a brand new copy. In the old version I ran `cca plugin list` to get a list of plugins, and then added them one by one into the new app. I'm using a couple chrome plugins like `cordova-plugin-chrome-apps-power` that I just pulled over, I didn't worry about the core chrome libraries.\n\nAdd `<script src='cordova.js'></script>` to your html file\n\n`manifest.json` and `manifest.mobile.json` are no longer useful, instead you need to manually add `<icon>` and `<splash>` tags to `config.xml`. I also had to add `<access origin=\"*\" />` instead of my custom CSP I was using before.\n\nIn `/platforms/android` I added a new file, `build-extras.gradle` that's just a one-liner that tells cordova to use the release keys I created for cca. This was the part I was most worried about, but it appears to be working correctly. Here's the file:\n\n<pre>ext.cdvReleaseSigningPropertiesFile = '../../android-release-keys.properties'</pre>\n\nI think I also had to manually copy some splash screen images to get them working.\n\nTo build apks (mostly) the same way as before, I run 4 lines of code (there's probably a way to do this without installing-uninstalling crosswalk, but I'm not that smart):\n\n<pre>cordova plugin add cordova-plugin-crosswalk-webview\ncordova build android --release -- --gradleArg=-PcdvBuildMultipleApks=true\ncordova plugin remove cordova-plugin-crosswalk-webview\ncordova build android --release -- --gradleArg=-PcdvMinSdkVersion=21 --gradleArg=-PcdvBuildMultipleApks=false</pre>\n\nThere are probably a lot more elegant ways to handle this stuff, and I probably forgot something, but hopefully this is helpful. I just pushed my first version of the new app to the Play Store, and it looks like everything is jiving..\n"
