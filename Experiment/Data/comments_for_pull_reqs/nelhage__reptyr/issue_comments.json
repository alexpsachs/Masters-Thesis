You can either close the old terminal (reptyr should protect rtorrent against being killed when you do so), or you can background rtorrent using `^Z` in the new window, and then run `bg; disown` in the old terminal to detach it entirely.\n\nI've just pushed a fix that should fix attaching processes run via screen. Can you let me know if it works for you?\n"

But it means that any security bugs in `reptyr` -- buffer overflows, etc -- are now exploitable for root access on your system.

My suspicion is that even if we added a (e.g.) FreeBSD port, we could get away with one file of definitions for Linux, and one for FreeBSD, and a simple conditional inclusion. The real value of autoconf is if there are N different axes along which platforms can be different, and you want to consider each of them individually.\n"

        "body": "This is really cool. Impressive lateral thinking, Nelson.\n\nA couple of initial surprises that I'm not sure I'd consider bugs:\n1. You can't seem to re-parent a session twice. E.g. if I use `reptyr -T 3822` to grab a target session everything works as expected and subprocesses seem to have the same PIDs. However, if I open a new terminal and run `reptyr -T 3822` again it can't seem to find the (still existing) session. I get `[-] Unable to find the fd for the pty!`.\n2. Exiting a backgrounded process of the original terminal leaves it suspended. I.e. If you open a process \"blah\", background it, then reptyr another session, then exit \"blah\", it remains suspended. After exiting the reptyred (is that an acceptable verb now?) session \"blah\" is still suspended and you need to foreground it to have it terminate.\n"

You might want to uninstall the apt-get-provided version to avoid confusion though.\r\n\r\nWith regards to what directory to put it in, Linux isn't particularly picky about where you put things. For example, you could install it to ~/reptyr and then run it as `~/reptyr/bin/reptyr`. If you want to be able to run it by just typing `reptyr` you'll want to look into modifying your `PATH` variable and your ~/.bashrc or equivalent. Some searching online should turn up plenty of advice for doing this."

If the output was\r\n       truncated due to this limit, then the return value  is  the  number  of\r\n       characters  (excluding the terminating null byte) which would have been\r\n       written to the final string if enough space had been available.   Thus,\r\n       a  return  value  of  size or more means that the output was truncated.\r\n       (See also below under NOTES.)\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhich suggests to me that this comparison is a valid way to check for truncation.\r\n\r\nI'm not really sure what the right fix is here. `sun_path` is fixed size and I can't change that, and as far as I can tell I'm correctly using `snprintf` to avoid overflow, and detect the truncation and error out, which is pretty much the only correct thing I can do if the path is too long."
