        "body": "Thanks for the quick support. Although now I noticed a really weird bug, kind of hard to explain.\n\nFor the sake of the explanation, the first test should always fail.\n\nthe shared example:\n\n``` objective-c\nsharedExamplesFor(@\"a group item\", ^(NSDictionary *data) {\n  it(@\"should be a group item\", ^{\n    id item = data[@\"item\"] ;\n    bool isGroupItem = [data[@\"delegate\"] outlineView: nil isGroupItem:item] ;\n    bool expectedValue = [data[@\"isGroupItem\"] boolValue] ;\n\n    expect(isGroupItem).to.equal(expectedValue) ;\n  }) ;\n});\n```\n\nand the specs:\n\n``` objective-c\n  beforeEach(^{\n    project = [[Project alloc] init] ;\n    delegate = [[ApiProjectOulineViewDelegate alloc] init] ;\n  }) ;\n\n    describe(@\"a service\", ^{\n      itShouldBehaveLike(@\"a group item\", ^{ return @{  @\"item\": [[Service alloc] init],\n                                             @\"delegate\": delegate,\n                                             @\"isGroupItem\": [NSNumber numberWithBool:NO]} ; }) ;\n    }) ;\n\n    describe(@\"a resource\", ^{\n      itShouldBehaveLike(@\"a group item\", @{ @\"item\": [[Resource alloc] init],\n                                             @\"delegate\": [[ApiProjectOulineViewDelegate alloc] init],\n                                             @\"isGroupItem\": [NSNumber numberWithBool:NO]}) ;\n    }) ;\n```\n\nNotice the second specs does not use the variable delegate but create a new one. In that case, I've got an expected failure for the first spec.\n\nnow if I change the second spec to use the delegate block variable, but I forget to use a block to return the dictionary:\n\n``` objective-c\n  beforeEach(^{\n    project = [[Project alloc] init] ;\n    delegate = [[ApiProjectOulineViewDelegate alloc] init] ;\n  }) ;\n\n describe(@\"a service\", ^{\n      itShouldBehaveLike(@\"a group item\", ^{ return @{  @\"item\": [[Service alloc] init],\n                                             @\"delegate\": delegate,\n                                             @\"isGroupItem\": [NSNumber numberWithBool:NO]} ; }) ;\n    }) ;\n\n    describe(@\"a resource\", ^{\n      itShouldBehaveLike(@\"a group item\", @{ @\"item\": [[Resource alloc] init], // I forgot to change add the block\n                                             @\"delegate\": delegate,\n                                             @\"isGroupItem\": [NSNumber numberWithBool:NO]}) ;\n    }) ;\n```\n\nNow I've got no failure, and the shared example is never executed, so silently the specs are not executed anymore.\n\nDavid\n"

This means that the first `dispatch_semaphore_wait` will always complete immediately, which is probably not what you want.\n2. The semaphore isn't recreated each time the `beforeAll` block is run (relevant if it's in a `describe` block). I'd probably move the variable and initialization into there.\n3. If `-loginWithUserName:\u2026` needs to do any work on the main thread \u2014 like delivering its results there \u2014 it won't be able to, since you'll be blocking on the semaphore.\n\nInstead, if you're also using [expecta](https://github.com/specta/expecta), you can use the `will` matcher to solve all of the above problems:\n\n``` objc\nbeforeAll(^{\n    // This is run once and only once before all of the examples\n    // in this group and before any beforeEach blocks.\n\n    // Set a timeout of 100 sec\n    setAsyncSpecTimeout(100);\n\n    Login *login = [[Login alloc] init];\n\n    __block BOOL completed = NO;\n    [login loginWithUserName:@\"user\"\n                    passWord:@\"pass\"\n                   onSuccess:^(id responseObject) {\n                       // Handle successful login\n                       completed = YES;\n                   }\n                     onError:^(NSError *err) {\n                       // Handle error\n                         completed = YES;\n                     }];\n\n    expect(completed).will.beTruthy();\n});\n```\n\nAs a sidenote, 100 seconds is way too long to be waiting for results in a unit test.

It's the ability make assignments once and use them in multiple examples and example groups.  RSpec's `let` also lazy evaluates and memoizes.  The main objective of this feature is for this value.  \n\nIt's also better DRY approach, IMHO.  I'm not sure what conventions folks use to create reusable code in Specta, but I like the readability of this approach, along with lazy evaluation.\n\nI also decided that each example group needs to retains it's own key/value collection, such that, if a few examples need a different value, their example group could define its own value w/o affecting the rest.  I'm not sure if that could be done cleanly with other DRY approaches people use with Specta (again, I could be wrong).\n\nIf you feel the feature is worth while, kill this pull request and I'll work on the new syntax.\n\nThx\nb\n"

If the code used to make the assignment is costly, single execution is preferred.  In RSPec land, I have dozens of examples for a Spec which use Fixtures, which are in the DB and transactional, so memoziation across lots of specs adds up in perf gains.  \n\nSecond, they're lazy evaluated, so if examples upstream from a `get` fail, the code will not even fire.  IMHO, executing code at the time it's needed, in the example block, instead of way before hand in before blocks, help reduce side effects between examples by keeping examples more isolated.  \n\nb\n"

        "body": "My commit above re-adds support for custom reporters, but the format has changed to be compatible with Xcode's test integration features.\n\nThis is a much simpler implementation than the original. SPTReporter is simply a subclass of XCTestLog so its output should track any changes made by the Xcode team. As just another observer, it should play well with any 3rd-party observers too.\n\nThe only non-standard aspect is that I was forced to swizzle -[XCTestLog startObserving] and -[XCTestLog stopObserving]. There was no other way to force XCTest to use SPTReporter without requiring users to explicitly add the -XCTestObserverClass default to their test scheme.\n"

That works a treat :thumbsup: \n\nRelated: we should have an open radar issue filed publicly that people can duplicate and submit to Apple's Bug Reporter asking for more flexible test support in Xcode. It seems to me that Xcode is heading in the direction of more fully supporting differing test syntax like that Specta uses, but duped radars help get issues like this more attention.\n\nIs there something already written that we can use? It might be good to promote something like this \u2014 I'm sure the Kiwi guys would get behind it too.\n"

If ya ask me, the burden should be on services like Travis to upgrade to Xcode 6, not for libraries like Specta to support stragglers.\n"

However, Specta should be able to randomize the order of the individual examples defined by those subclasses by shuffling the invocations returned by [`+[SPTXCTestCase testInvocations]`](https://github.com/specta/specta/blob/6eef3072d96a583438f12e379cdd62add9cd7ce6/src/SPTXCTestCase.m#L124).\n\nThis shuffling should help catch examples that depend on previous examples in the same spec class. But it won't help to find examples that depend on examples in other spec classes.\n\nIt might be possible to shuffle the spec classes themselves by shuffling the classes returned by [the swizzled `+[XCTestCase xct_allSubclasses]` method](https://github.com/specta/specta/blob/6eef3072d96a583438f12e379cdd62add9cd7ce6/src/XCTestCase+Specta.m#L23)--which I believe [was made public as of Xcode 6](https://github.com/specta/specta/blob/e91c0f8a51df6158413efe4ac3582c8fe9e442e7/src/XCTestCase+Specta.m#L8).\n\nOne question, @orta: you can randomize examples in RSpec using command line arguments: `rspec --order random`. How would you want to randomize examples in Specta? Command line arguments as well?\n"

And, \"The UI is no different \u2014\u00a0it needs to be tested too!\" is a thought I have had.\n\nIn the last 10 months I've come to learn that while it's a powerful tool, you have to be careful that when you're holding a hammer, everything looks like a nail (two hammer-and-nail related idioms so far. What's going on today! :P). I guarantee you this:   BDD for building UIs is a painful, wasteful and low-value exercise. \n\nSee http://www.rbcs-us.com/documents/Why-Most-Unit-Testing-is-Waste.pdf.\n\nApple keeps telling MVC lie \u2014\u00a0that the View Controller is the 'Controller'. **It isn't**. View Controllers set up, create, configure, remove, handle segues between, VIEWS.  The **View Controller is View code** \u2014\u00a0the 'V' of MVC. _Not_ the 'C'.\n\n**Test your code. Not the View.**\n\nUse Specta and Expecta to test your logic and your Models.\n\nUse things [KIF](https://github.com/kif-framework/KIF) / [Calabash](https://github.com/calabash/calabash-ios) / [Substrate](https://github.com/inkling/Subliminal) to physically 'click through' your application to test whether your Views are behaving as they should. This is what exercises your View Controller code.\n\n**Test whether you can Log in with a correct username and password**. That's the behaviour that needs testing, not whether the login view controller appears. You'll fail to find the username box if the view controller doesn't appear. You won't need to know about `presentingViewController != nil` to find that out. It's either on screen, or not!\n\nI personally use a MVVM-inspired architecture. There are Views, View Models, and Models. I test the View Models and Models exclusively and leave the Views alone \u2014 I've not had time to automate tests for those yet.\n"

So many Objective-C methods now under ARC are of the form:\n\n```\n- (NSObject *)doSomethingWithInput:(NSObject *)input error:(NSError * __autoreleasing *)error;\n```\n\nWe need to be able to test `error`.  If Specta can't handle that due to its use of blocks, we need a workaround or it's difficult to use Specta for testing these methods (and there are many methods like this).\n\nAny suggestions?  :-)\n\nThanks!\n"

        "body": "@bwaresiak the problem here is that you're not using `it` and `beforeEach` blocks in `sharedExamplesFor`. Under the hood they behave just like a describe block (which can be passed some additional info). \n\nThus the appropriate approach would be:\n\n```\nsharedExamplesFor(@\"shared example\", ^(NSDictionary* data)\n{\n    beforeEach(^{\n        NSString *something = data[SBEventKey];\n    });\n\n    it(@\"should work\", ^{\n        expect(something).toNot.beNil();\n        expect(something).to.equal(@\"something\");\n    });\n});\n```\n\nAnd it is absolutely legal (actually required) to use `it` with shared behaviours. The fact that your tests were passing in the first place is probably because you passed in a simple dictionary to your `itShouldBehaveLike` rather than a block that generates a dict, tho I'm not 100% sure about this. \n\n@orta this probably means a better documentation on shared examples is needed, there were two issues where people reported problems with using them. (other issue: https://github.com/specta/specta/issues/103)\n"

So we could add inline documentation in `Specta/Specta/SPTExampleGroup.m` before line 26 along the lines of:\n\n```\n// Specta supports blacklisting specific Classes from being treated as before/after helper classes\n// to add an new class to the list add the following lines to a project initialiser ( e.g. App Delegate callbacks )\n//\n//  Class accessbilitySafeCategoryClass = NSClassFromString(@\"MyClass\");\n//  class_addProtocol(accessbilitySafeCategoryClass, @protocol(SPTExcludeGlobalBeforeAfterEach));\n//\n```\n\nHow does that sound?\n"

I didn't even know that this is possible at all, but we ended up having duplicate classes with the same name when running the tests.\nAnd this explains perfectly well why it did not work using `NSClassFromString()`: The function returns only one of the two classes. And this is why it worked when iterating over all classes in the system and filtering for certain names.\n\nSo sorry for the confusion. This was an issue specific to our project setup, not an issue with Specta or the black list.\n"

Thus I'm a bit reluctant to seeing this change\n- It's a bit more complicated for developers to integrate with this feature (however it does seem likely if that they read about it in docs they'll stumble upon the whitelisting method)\n- Requires a bit of work for people who already implement this\n\nNow going back to the problem @wasnotrice has. Let's quickly go through your stack trace:\n\n```\n    0   CoreFoundation                      0x0000000107d50f35 __exceptionPreprocess + 165\n    1   libobjc.A.dylib                     0x0000000106e56bb7 objc_exception_throw + 45\n    2   CoreFoundation                      0x0000000107d50e6d +[NSException raise:format:] + 205\n    3   libdispatch.dylib                   0x00000001088bbaf4 _dispatch_client_callout + 8\n    4   libdispatch.dylib                   0x00000001088a9e72 dispatch_once_f + 129\n    5   popSlate                            0x0000000102d58937 AVYSDKResourceBundle + 312\n    6   popSlateTests                       0x0000000113af15d5 +[AVYPhotoEditorCustomization initialize] + 53\n    7   libobjc.A.dylib                     0x0000000106e574d6 _class_initialize + 648\n    8   libobjc.A.dylib                     0x0000000106e606e1 lookUpImpOrForward + 351\n    9   libobjc.A.dylib                     0x0000000106e6d0d3 objc_msgSend + 211\n    10  libobjc.A.dylib                     0x0000000106e55599 _class_resolveMethod + 124\n    11  libobjc.A.dylib                     0x0000000106e60707 lookUpImpOrForward + 389\n    12  libobjc.A.dylib                     0x0000000106e6045f class_getInstanceMethod + 60\n    13  popSlateTests                       0x00000001137ec2e5 ClassesWithClassMethod + 245\n    14  popSlateTests                       0x00000001137ec1cc __44-[SPTExampleGroup runGlobalBeforeEachHooks:]_block_invoke + 28\n    15  libdispatch.dylib                   0x00000001088bbaf4 _dispatch_client_callout + 8\n    16  libdispatch.dylib                   0x00000001088a9e72 dispatch_once_f + 129\n    17  popSlateTests                       0x00000001137ebf9f -[SPTExampleGroup runGlobalBeforeEachHooks:] + 159\n    18  popSlateTests                       0x00000001137ece6f -[SPTExampleGroup runBeforeEachHooks:] + 159\n    19  popSlateTests                       0x00000001137ec826 -[SPTExampleGroup runBeforeHooks:] + 118\n    20  popSlateTests                       0x00000001137eebd6 __44-[SPTExampleGroup compileExamplesWithStack:]_block_invoke136 + 166\n    21  popSlateTests                       0x00000001137f14eb -[SPTSpec spt_runExample:] + 347\n    22  popSlateTests                       0x00000001137f0f9d __35+[SPTSpec spt_convertToTestMethod:]_block_invoke + 93\n    23  CoreFoundation                      0x0000000107c48c8c __invoking___ + 140\n    24  CoreFoundation                      0x0000000107c48ae2 -[NSInvocation invoke] + 290\n    25  XCTest                              0x00000001146fe0f7 -[XCTestCase invokeTest] + 253\n    26  XCTest                              0x00000001146fe2f8 -[XCTestCase performTest:] + 150\n    27  popSlateTests                       0x00000001137f2119 -[SPTSpec performTest:] + 137\n    28  XCTest                              0x0000000114707bf5 -[XCTest run] + 260\n    29  XCTest                              0x00000001146fcffb -[XCTestSuite performTest:] + 379\n    30  XCTest                              0x0000000114707bf5 -[XCTest run] + 260\n    31  XCTest                              0x00000001146fcffb -[XCTestSuite performTest:] + 379\n    32  XCTest                              0x0000000114707bf5 -[XCTest run] + 260\n    33  XCTest                              0x00000001146fcffb -[XCTestSuite performTest:] + 379\n    34  XCTest                              0x0000000114707bf5 -[XCTest run] + 260\n    35  XCTest                              0x00000001146fa0bc __25-[XCTestDriver _runSuite]_block_invoke + 56\n    36  XCTest                              0x0000000114704ead -[XCTestObservationCenter _observeTestExecutionForBlock:] + 162\n    37  XCTest                              0x00000001146f9ff0 -[XCTestDriver _runSuite] + 269\n    38  XCTest                              0x00000001146faa1d -[XCTestDriver _checkForTestManager] + 234\n    39  XCTest                              0x000000011470aaf0 +[XCTestProbe runTests:] + 182\n    40  Foundation                          0x0000000106a0fd55 __NSFireDelayedPerform + 387\n    41  CoreFoundation                      0x0000000107cb8f64 __CFRUNLOOP_IS_CALLING_OUT_TO_A_TIMER_CALLBACK_FUNCTION__ + 20\n    42  CoreFoundation                      0x0000000107cb8b25 __CFRunLoopDoTimer + 1045\n    43  CoreFoundation                      0x0000000107c7be5d __CFRunLoopRun + 1901\n    44  CoreFoundation                      0x0000000107c7b486 CFRunLoopRunSpecific + 470\n    45  GraphicsServices                    0x000000010948d9f0 GSEventRunModal + 161\n    46  UIKit                               0x00000001056ff420 UIApplicationMain + 1282\n    47  popSlate                            0x0000000102ba3c33 main + 115\n    48  libdyld.dylib                       0x00000001088ec145 start + 1\n```\n\nThe issue here is that there our code results in `+[AVYPhotoEditorCustomization initialize]` being called. `+[NSObject initialize]` is called only when a class gets loaded into runtime. Docs are a bit more specific:\n\n> The runtime sends initialize to each class in a program just before the class, or any class that inherits from it, is sent its first message from within the program. The runtime sends the initialize message to classes in a thread-safe manner. Superclasses receive this message before their subclasses. The superclass implementation may be called multiple times if subclasses do not implement initialize\u2014the runtime will call the inherited implementation\u2014or if subclasses explicitly call [super initialize]. If you want to protect yourself from being run multiple times, you can structure your implementation along these lines:\n> \n> Because initialize is called in a thread-safe manner and the order of initialize being called on different classes is not guaranteed, it\u2019s important to do the minimum amount of work necessary in initialize methods. Specifically, any code that takes locks that might be required by other classes in their initialize methods is liable to lead to deadlocks. Therefore you should not rely on initialize for complex initialization, and should instead limit it to straightforward, class local initialization.\n\nIt seems that Aviary is doing some weird stuff in their initialize method which then leads to this crash. \n\nNow the reason why I think this will not work. Code responsible for both blacklisting and whitelisting is nearly the same:\n\nBlacklisting:\n\n```\nclass_conformsToProtocol(aClass, @protocol(SPTExcludeGlobalBeforeAfterEach)) == NO\n```\n\nWhitelisting:\n\n```\nclass_conformsToProtocol(aClass, @protocol(SPTIncludeGlobalBeforeAfterEach)) == YES\n```\n\nand thus I don't see any reason why it will not call `+[NSObject initialize]` as well, which will, unfortunately, result in the same issue as @wasnotrice described. \n\nThe real solution here would be to add logic that somehow checks whether a class conforms to protocol without actually initializing it. I'm not sure how `class_conformsToProtocol` behaves and whether it actually initializes classes. \n\nAnother thing you can try is to avoid `NSClassFromString(@\"AVYPhotoEditorCustomization\");` and use `objc_lookUpClass` which is a bit more low-level and might actually not call `+[NSObject initialize]`. \n"

I'm pretty sure this issue is unavoidable even with whitelisting mechanism\n\nThere are [other approaches](https://github.com/Quick/Quick/blob/47079aea66854e9398cf211037d7409bf40b2e5d/Documentation/ConfiguringQuick.md#adding-global-beforeeach-and-aftereach-closures), ones that doesn't involve checking the class list for protocol conformance in either direction. I don't think that's the only way to do it, and would love to see more, but I don't necessarily think looking for protocol _conformance_ (as opposed to adoption, or some other method) is the best approach. As you mention, there have been at least two false positives since the feature was introduced.\n\n> It's a bit more complicated for developers to integrate with this feature\n\nMaybe it's just me, but I struggle to think of when this feature might be necessary. I know of only two users in the real world: @wasnotrice and [libgit2/objective-git](https://github.com/libgit2/objective-git). I'd rather it be a little harder to use than for users to accidentally have it fire on them. I mean, take a look at [the PR that introduced the opt-out feature](https://github.com/specta/specta/pull/131/files): it includes a code comment that says \"If you're seeing a crash here then...\", which I think is a pretty bad experience for users. (Sorry if that sounds harsh--I think the set of PRs that @paweldudek sent are a massive improvement on the whole! I just think that code comment highlights the issue we're seeing here.)\n\n> Requires a bit of work for people who already implement this\n\nThis, I think, is the biggest problem with changing how it currently works. I don't want to change an API that people rely upon. https://github.com/specta/specta/pull/149 does that, and users who use the feature are going to have to make changes to keep up. I think it's worth it to make sure that's absolutely necessary in this case, and whether they may be a better approach to global before/after each as a whole.\n"

From what I can tell, the problem here is that @wasnotrice is trying to opt-out _before_ his class is picked up by Specta's code, so he needed to find a way to dynamically opt-out in time. With a whitelisting mechanism, users won't accidentally be opted-in, so they won't have to race Specta in order to prevent a crash. :snail: \n"

        "body": "@modocache no problem! \n\nSo the issue @wasnotrice is seeing is caused by Aviary SDK hitting an assertion in their `[NSObject initialize]` method (which sounds like a horrible design, but that's a different story :wink:). Specta tries to send `beforeEach` (as we can see in the stack trace) message to that class, which triggers `initialize`, which then results in an exception. \n\n`initialize` method is, according to docs, sent before first message is received by given class. And is sent only once per given class (however since some classes do not implement it superclasses can receive this call multiple times). \n\n@wasnotrice noted that he tried to exclude that class using previous method with blacklisting protocol. However that did not work and the exception was still raised. \n\nNow there are two possibilities here. Either previous blacklisting mechanism was broken (as it allowed that class to somehow slip through, in this case I'm 100% for changing to whitelisting) or something else triggered that `[NSObject initialize]` call (that's why I'd love to see the stack trace for this exception when blacklisting is added). \n\nIt is possible that code for adding blacklisting protocol somehow resulted in an `initialize` message being sent to `AVYPhotoEditorCustomization`, but I'm not sure how is that possible as my simple test confirmed that using\n- `objc_lookUpClass`\n- `NSClassFromString`\n\ndoes not trigger `initialize`. \n\nAnd the opt-out mechanism works at the same time as opt-in mechanism so, from behavior perspective, there should be no difference between adding a blacklisting/whitelisting here (aka the `ClassesWithClassMethod` function). \n\nAlso, I sort of convinced myself that whitelisting might be a better idea - it's way more complicated to explain what to do if you don't want to use global before/after each methods rather than explain what to do if you want to have them. \n\n> Maybe it's just me, but I struggle to think of when this feature might be necessary.\n\nI might be opposing this a bit as I know how many global hooks like that we have in our codebase and my subconscious tells me it's gonna be quite a lot of work to update all our private pods to make specs work again :wink:\n"

        "body": "Thanks all for your feedback and consideration.\n\n@paweldudek The [failure is the same](https://gist.github.com/wasnotrice/2bcb6ab2dcde4a8b8967) when I add the blacklist protocol, whether I use `NSClassFromString()` or `objc_lookUpClass()`. The log shows that the protocol was added to the class, and those are the very first lines of the log, so it seems like it's happening as early as possible.\n\nThis is an intermittent failure. Tests tend to pass once or twice and then start failing. Once they start failing, it seems like they fail more frequently, but that may be psychological. In any case, I get this error at least 30% of the time.\n\nSince the failure is intermittent, I can't be sure that the whitelisting method actually prevents it, but I have run the suite 15 times or so without error, which never happens with blacklisting.\n\n@orta I don't know if you have other reasons for moving to 1.0, but I don't think there's anything wrong with breaking changes in a pre-1.0 project. I'm prepared for that when I use a project at 0.4.0 :)\n\nI agree with @paweldudek that the whitelisting approach is easier to explain/understand. I was surprised that I had to add code to _prevent_ Specta from executing methods in my codebase that I didn't want to execute.\n"

A greater detail of the answer is here should someone be interested:\n\nhttps://github.com/AliSoftware/OHHTTPStubs/wiki/A-tricky-case-with-Application-Tests\n\nMy initial thoughts rested upon the fact that some testing/scripting frameworks may reload the classes to nix any dynamic/meta methods added and other misc reasons, and wondered if that could be possible here. But apparently, that was not the case. Anyways, the framework rocks and really appreciate you getting me onto the right track. Happy coding!\n"

Nothing more. \n\nExpecta's responsibility is to provide set of assertions for, well, asserting whether certain behaviour occurred. \n\nThis feels like a specific matcher that leaked into Spectas internal architecture, especially this method: \n\n``` objc\n- (void)spt_checkThis:(id)obj {\n  SPTCheckerObj *checkObj = [SPTCheckerObj new];\n  checkObj.obj = obj;\n  checkObj.checkBlock = ^(id checkingObj) {\n    XCTAssertNil(checkingObj);\n  };\n  @synchronized(self.checkerObjs) {\n    [self.checkerObjs addObject:checkObj];\n  }\n}\n```\n\nas it actually contains a matcher (which should be a part of Expecta). Perhaps it is possible to extend Specta to provide sort of generic interface which Expecta could use and that would solve your problem?\n\nAlso, personally I just write a test that contains an `@autorelease` and a `__weak` variable before it and then just use Expecta to check whether object has been released. It's a bit longer but it does the trick :wink:\n"

        "body": "Thanks for the issue, @mickeyreiss!! Super cool stuff. :gift_heart: \n\nhttps://github.com/Quick/Quick/pull/328 solved a very similar issue in Quick. From the commit messages:\n\n> XCTAssert macros must use some internal machinery to report failures. Quick specs don't have the correct state to report failures, but the XCTestRun objects passed to the -[XCTestCase performTest:] method do. Use those instead.\n\nPerhaps Specta (and I imagine Quick will have to do this as well) could achieve a similar solution for test expectations by ensuring that `XCTestExpectation` objects interact with the current `XCTestRun`, not the `SPTSpec` itself. Maybe override `-[SPTSpec -expectationWithDescription:]`, like so?\n\n``` objc\n// SPTSpec.m\n\n- (XCTestExpectation *)expectationWithDescription:(NSString *)description {\n  // Specta stores the current test run in a property called `spt_run`.\n  // This is the test run passed to `-[XCTestCase performTest:]`.\n  return [self.spt_run expectationWithDescription:description];\n}\n```\n\n> All this with the caveat that I'd recommend simply using Expecta's (or [Nimble's](https://github.com/Quick/Nimble)) asynchronous expectations.\n\nI'm curious, though--why does this pull request pass the CI? Shouldn't it be crashing?\n\nThis internal wackiness around `XCTAssert` macros and `XCTestExpectation` objects is confusing. I'll try to reach out to the XCTest team to see what the dealio is. If anyone wants to file a radar, that'd be swell, too! :+1: \n"

What I'm seeing is that the second time the you run a spec similar to the one above, the last test does not appear on the test navigator.\n\nSince Quick is suffering with the same problem, I guessed that the problem might not even be Specta, but XCTest.\n\nSo I did what the core of Specta does, which is to create the test on runtime by overriding `+[XCTestCase testInvocations]` and creating some tests at runtime.\n\nIt's something like [this](https://github.com/dbarden/testXCTest/blob/master/testXCTestTests/DBATestCase.m). It creates 3 tests a at runtime\n\nThe Test Navigator will report only 2 tests running, even though the report and the console will report 3 correctly.\n\nWhat's more interesting is that the results on test navigator are correct until the method -`[_XCTestDriverTestObserver testBundleDidFinish:]` is hit. During the execution of that method, the test navigator is updated and one result disappears..\n\nI tested Specta, Quick and Cedar and all of them had this behaviour, what makes the point that the Test Navigator and runtime tests are not in their best terms currently.\n"

Since Specta prepares all tests the moment spec classes are initialised (aka accessed for the first time via `+[XCTestSuite allTests]`) this might cause your tests to crash. \n\nI assume you're setting up Core Data stack somewhere in your App Delegate. One could do a simple tests and see which gets called first in `xcodebuild` and `xctool` - the Specta test initialisation (aka code between `before`/`after`/`it` blocks) or the app delegate callbacks. \n\nLast but not leasts it might be a good idea to mention this in docs. :+1: \n"

For me, the problem was easily solved by just moving some setup code into before blocks.\n\nThanks for the information!\n"

Or the focus the whole describe block?\n\nLastly, what would you do to get all the contents of a block to focus? (focus all of the inner blocks individually?)\n\nThis change would add no additional behaviour, and actually remove (make more verbose) a behaviour that is currently possible. Incidentally, in order to \"run only the fit\" all you need to do is to specify only the fit (not the fdescribe)... was your workflow first to focus on the describe then narrow down to the it block? If so I can see how you got there, but all you need do is remove the fdescribe and add the fit(s).\n\n(I'm sorry that my first contribution here could be seen as purely negative, but no-one else seemed to be making this point and I can't see how this change would be an improvement, quite the opposite.)\n\nThanks.\n"

Then I switched to the `[XCTestCase waitForExpectationsWithTimeout:handler:]` async facility which gave me the repeated condition checking behavior, but also the error message this issue describes.
