        "body": "Hi Pradeep,\n\nHere is the code in [example 40](http://curran.github.io/screencasts/introToAngular/exampleViewer/#/40):\n\n``` javascript\ncountryApp.controller('CountryListCtrl', function ($scope, countries){\n  countries.list(function(countries) {\n    $scope.countries = countries;\n  });\n});\n```\n\nUnfortunately this code uses the variable name `countries` for two different things, which might be confusing. Here's a version with two different names:\n\n``` javascript\ncountryApp.controller('CountryListCtrl', function ($scope, countries){\n  countries.list(function(countriesList) {\n    $scope.countries = countriesList;\n  });\n});\n```\n\nThe code you have uses the array notation for dependency injection, but only specifies `$scope` as a dependency, not `countries`. Here's code similar to yours to show what is missing:\n\n``` javascript\ncountryApp.controller('CountryListCtrl', ['$scope', /* 'countries' should go here */ function ($scope, countries){\n  countries.list(function(countriesList) {\n    $scope.countries = countriesList;\n  });\n  console.log(countries);\n}]);\n```\n\nYou need to change your code to include `countries` as a dependency in the array, like this:\n\n``` javascript\ncountryApp.controller('CountryListCtrl', ['$scope', 'countries', function ($scope, countries){\n  countries.list(function(countriesList) {\n    $scope.countries = countriesList;\n  });\n  console.log(countries);\n}]);\n```\n\nHope this helps. Good luck.\n"

        "body": "Thanks for the reply Curran. \r\nI actually got it to work. I assume as Bootstrap has many navbar menu links that use the `<ul> <li>` tags - https://www.bootply.com/JdmcsrboOY (my navbar example), it caused some error. In the second line of the function setActiveLink (at the end), i had initially just called the ID of the `<nav>` and then the `<a>` tag: `$(\"#nav-main a\").each(function...`.\r\n\r\nI then remembered I was having a CSS issue stylizing the nav links until I defined the whole thing (example: `.navbar ul.nav li a:hover{color:red}`.\r\n\r\nAfter some trial and error, I changed it to `ul#nav-main li`, and it worked. The only small quirk now is when I refresh a page, it seems to load the index page first, then it reloads the correct page.\r\n\r\n     function setActiveLink(fragmentId){\r\n    $(\"ul#nav-main li\").each(function (i, linkElement) { \r\n      var link = $(linkElement),\r\n        pageName = link.attr(\"[href]\").substr(1);\r\n      if(pageName === fragmentId) {\r\n        link.attr(\"class\", \"active\");\r\n      } else {\r\n        link.removeAttr(\"class\");\r\n      }\r\n    });\r\n     }\r\n\r\nBut thanks again.
