I would be happy to try and help on the examples front, I am now considering implementing Oz in a user service i am devving called [lummox](https://github.com/smaxwellstewart/lummox).\n\nI am designing it as a microservice, and basically it is respnsible for the bits that Oz leaves out, CRUD of users and authenticating them. I was deliberately not going down the OAuth2 route as I hate it, so was using a JWT auth mechanism with refresh and access tokens. But Oz seems to have similar benefits (possibility of stateless session) with more layers of security.\n\nAnyway be great to see if I could implement it in this project but wandering what's the best place to start understanding it. I imagine just source code for now eh...\n"

Seems like there is a lot of layers of security, which is really good but does demand a fair amount of careful understanding of exactly what protection each is offering.\n\nHaving a working rest client for Hawk auth would really speed up dev as well.

Both oz and hawk are useful for app to server communication. The right solution depends on how you manage access, what your users use to login, etc. For example, if they enter a username and password on the app and then need to get back some token they can use to make api calls, hawk would be enough. If you don't want to do a token lookup every request, you can use iron to encode information into the token. I really can't help you beyond this. I suggest you find someone who has time to help who knows this space well. You should not design your system security based on this. Good luck.\n"

        "body": "@richardolsson the hawk package.json lists \"browser\" pointing to `dist/browser.js`.  If you use `require('oz/lib/client')` in browser code with webpack, then `dist/browser.js` will be referenced as opposed to Hawk's `lib/index.js` with its `lib/client.js`.\r\n\r\nThe authenticate function signature in `browser.js` accepts 4 arguments and synchronously returns a boolean.  The `client.js` authenticate accepts a 5th argument of a callback.  Thus the callback is never being called:\r\n\r\n    const OzClient = require('oz/lib/client');\r\n    new OzClient.Connection({uri, credentials}).request(\"/protected\", user_ticket, {}, (err, result, code, ticket) => {\r\n        // never reached\r\n    });\r\n\r\nThat might be the problem you're experiencing?  Anyway, if I can't iron (no pun intended ;) ) it out I will follow hueniverse's advice and build my own wrapper around hawk.  Though as you also said it would be nice to avoid copy and pasting the work hueniverse has put into the client.Connection helper for client-side applications."

He did not write a protocol because the \"problem with security protocols is that they are useless without an equally solid implementation. The only point in a protocol is interoperability and I don\u2019t care about interoperability.\" He just wants to, and with Oz also allows us to, build great and secure web products.\r\n\r\nI don't understand the \"unsupported propriety [sic] security technology\".  Whilst the license mentions yahoo's postmile, the copyright is owned by the contributors.  So it is proprietary but contribute and you become an owner.  Perhaps there is some relevant legalese I'm missing in your jurisdiction?   If so perhaps open a new issue or preferably submit a PR to the license to start a conversation.\r\n\r\nIs it dead?  Hueniverse interacted with it at least a month ago... I feel like I've misunderstood your point again though.\r\n\r\nRe: Complete spec / roadmap.  I believe the implementation is compete, (and that is the spec)\r\n\r\n> integrated with frameworks such as Kong\r\n\r\nThis would not live in this repo nor in the Kong repo but in a Kong-Oz repo surely?  And I'd have thought this would be very well received."
