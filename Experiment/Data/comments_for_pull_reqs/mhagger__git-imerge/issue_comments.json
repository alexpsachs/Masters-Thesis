According to [PEP 394](http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0394/), there should be an executable called python2 that runs a Python interpreter that is definitely 2.x.  Obviously this newish convention is still far from universal, but I decided to use it as the default for this reason.  I agree with you completely that we would need some kind of build/install procedure that rewrites the script with the correct shebang for the system it is running on.\n2. The test harness is still needed but I think my test-dirs branch is a start towards handling the temporary directory more sanely.\n"

(I think it might involve some libification and then the use of a mock repo object.)\n\nI see the cause of the problem in your case.  remove_failure() is not doing the right thing.  If there is a conflict like this:\n\n```\n*******\n*......\n*.....X\n*......\n```\n\nthen it should attempt to split the conflicting block into two blocks (one of which might be empty) like this:\n\n```\n*****||\n-----++\n*....|X\n-----+.\n```\n\nbut instead it is doing this:\n\n```\n*****|*\n*----+.\n*.....X\n*......\n```\n\nwhich is nonsense.  In your case the single block that it is producing is empty, so resolving it doesn't make any progress; hence the infinite loop.\n\nI'll work on this; I think it shouldn't be hard to fix (hopefully within the next hour or so).  Don't throw away your in-progress merge, because it should be possible to continue it with the fixed version of the software.  (And it would be a check that the fix really helped!)\n\n[Edit: middle diagram just fixed.]\n"

They have two parents, so it is ambiguous.  AFAIK Git sets the author and committer of a merge commit to the person doing the merging, not to those of either of the parent commits.\n\nIn the special case that the incremental merge is being simplified into a rebase, then I guess it would be reasonable to take the GIT_AUTHOR_\\* information from the old version of the commit.  (This must be the case that you are talking about.)  But shouldn't the GIT_COMMITTER_\\* information be set to the user doing the imerge?\n\nWhat should happen if you simplify the incremental merge into a simple merge?  Then I think the author and committer should be the person doing the imerging.  Do you agree?\n\nWhat if you simplify it into a rebase-with-history?  This is kindof a middle ground because the old commits are kept (thus preserving the old author and committer info).  I can see arguments for either approach--copying the original author info vs. setting the new author info to the person doing the imerge.  What do you think?\n"

But currently git-imerge doesn't let you access these intermediate states, so there's no point worrying about it until it can be tested more easily.\n\nThe colors really make the diagrams easier to read, and the integer-encoded diagrams will be easy to use for other output purposes.

That would make it possible to collaborate on a merge without even pushing and pulling between repos. Obviously, that comes at the cost of not (easily) being able to compile and test the code on your own machine, which probably defeats the idea in most use cases (unless if your \"codebase\" is not compilable/testable, e.g. a book or a collection of written prose, etc.)\n"

Therefore, git-imerge explicitly turns rerere off when it shells out to git.\n\nMeanwhile, I expect that the incremental merges done by git-imerge wouldn't benefit so much from rerere anyway, at least _within a single incremental merge_.  This is because the micromerges are recorded in the DAG and so their merge resolution is already available to Git without the need for additional rerere data.  Moreover, the fact that rerere data is local would make it more difficult to collaborate on incremental merges.\n\nWhere rerere _might_ help would be if, for example, an imerge is attempted multiple times, or part of the conflicts involved in the imerge have already been attempted previously as part of a simple merge or rebase.  In that case some of the conflict resolution might be able to be carried across from one merge to another, reducing the number of conflicts that have to be resolved manually.\n\nSo....\n\nIt might be advantageous to combine rerere with git-imerge, but it would need some careful testing and thought before I would recommend it.  Maybe one could gain the advantages without suffering from the problems by using rerere more selectively; for example, turning it on for manual merges but turning it off for automatic merges.\n"

        "body": "Yes, I think that should work fine.\n\nOne obvious approach would be to rebase (or rebase-with-history) the current state of the refactoring branch to the current state of master, and just repeat this step periodically as master progresses.  This would have the benefit that  after you do a rebase, the subsequent work that you do on the branch will be on top of the changes that have been done on trunk between the branch's old branch point and its new branch point, so you will intrinsically have fewer conflicts.\n\nIf the incremental merge is too much work to do at once, you could also work on the incremental merge across several sittings, simply leaving the in-progress imerge in your repo between attempts.  If work on master or (especially) branch continue during your imerge, you could leave the results of the first incremental merge in your repo and expand the completed part of the incremental merge diagram one rectangle at a time.  So, for example, if the first imerge was \"imerge1\", then you could do\n\n```\ngit checkout imerge1\ngit imerge start --name=imerge2 --goal=GOAL --first-parent wipbranch\n```\n\nwhere \"wipbranch\" is the current state of the WIP branch, which includes more commits than the ones that were included in imerge1.  The only thing that might be awkward is simplifying the final imerge into the rebase that you ultimately want.  Given the current state of imerge, you would have to do that by hand using the \"git imerge reparent\" command or other fancy Git trickery.\n\nCertainly, git-imerge could be made to support this workflow better.  Contributions are welcome.\n"

        "body": "In general, rebasing only part of a branch is [not a well-formed operation](http://softwareswirl.blogspot.com/2009/08/git-mercurial-and-bazaarsimplicity.html) in a DAG-based history.  However, it just occurred to me that the removal of a commit or sequence of commits from a branch could be framed as an incremental merge.  Suppose you have two commits, A and B, and you want to remove A from the history:\n\n```\no - A - B\n```\n\nIt is possible to compute A\u207b\u00b9, the inverse of A, in the context of A (this cannot conflict):\n\n```\no - A - A\u207b\u00b9\n    |\n    B\n```\n\nNow if you merge these two \"branches\", you get\n\n```\no - A - A\u207b\u00b9\n    |   |\n    B - B'\n```\n\nwhere the merge commit, B' is effectively commit B without commit A.\n\nThis can be generalized to removing an arbitrary number of contiguous commits followed by an arbitrary number of commits that you want to retain.  I don't see an obvious way to generalize it to removing multiple intervals of unwanted commits except for the trivial approach of removing them one interval at a time.\n\nBut this workflow is not yet supported by git-imerge, so you would have to do at least part of it manually.  If you would like to work on implementing this in git-imerge, I would be happy to help you get started.\n"

The commits marked with numbers (automatic) are the ones I am not sure about if they should be kept or not.\n\nThe 'a' merges should be kept because they are the ones generated by the m manual merge.\nThe 'b' merges seem to be necessary because they are outputs of manual merges and are inputs for F (directly on indirectly).\n\nWhat seems to be unclear to me is if the automatic merges marked with 1 and 2 should be kept as inputs for the manual merges and the final merge, respectively. Should 1 be input for the n and o manual merges? It does contain information as a result of the m merge, but what does make more sense, keeping 1 as parent for n and o, or to drop 1 and have only a nodes as parents for n and o?\n\nThe node 2 is similar to 1, but it shouldn't be problematic since is automatic.\n\nI wonder if keeping only the m, n, o commits and their \\* parents (or previous manual merges as parents) makes more sense, while having the F commit multi-parent, with all the manual merges as parents (except the manual merges which have another manual merge as child).\n\nWhat do you think?\n"

        "body": "Ahh, that's an interesting problem.  The merge didn't fail because the two commits conflicted, but rather because of other cruft in your working tree.  We'll have to find a way to deal with that.\n\nThe error occurs because `git imerge continue` tries to add the merge commit pointed to by reference `refs/heads/imerge/$NAME` into the incremental merge (where `$NAME` is the name that you gave this incremental merge).  Since there was no real conflict, I guess you didn't commit a merge commit.  So `refs/heads/imerge/$NAME` is not a merge between two conflicting parents, and the tool doesn't know how to proceed.  If I understand correctly, there was no conflict at all, and so there is no need for manual merge resolution.  What is your current `git status`?  Is it still in thinks-it's-conflicted state?  Is the tree clean but still waiting for a merge commit (i.e., is there a .git/MERGE_HEAD)?\n\nTo solve the problem, simply delete the branch `refs/heads/imerge/$NAME`, remove the un-checked-in .config file, and then type `git imerge continue` again.  I _think_ it will then set up the same merge, which this time shouldn't have any conflicts, bit it will nevertheless ask you to resolve the conflicts and commit.  You should just commit a merge commit to appease the tool and then `git imerge continue` as usual.\n\nObviously this situation has to be handled better by the tool:\n- Perhaps it should specifically diagnose when a merge failed because of an uncommitted file in the working copy and ask the user to clean up before retrying.\n- Probably if `request_user_merge()` sets up a merge but the merge doesn't conflict, then the tool should just continue without user input.\n- The documentation should be improved.\n\nPlease report whether that helps.\n"

The problem is with the metadata that is passed to \"git commit-tree\" via the environment (not the command line), which in turn is determined in MergeState.simplify_to_rebase() by calling get_author_info(orig).  Would you please print the contents of the \"metadata\" variable that is being passed to commit_tree()?  If (as I expect) the GIT_AUTHOR_DATE value is not a valid date, then please print \"orig\" and the output of the following commands:\n\n```\ngit --no-pager log -n1 --format='%an%x00%ae%x00%ad' $ORIG | hexdump -C\n\ngit cat-file commit $ORIG\n```\n\nMy guess is that you have a config setting \"log.date\" that is causing the date to be emitted in a format that git-imerge doesn't expect and (more to the point) that \"git commit-tree\" cannot parse.\n\nNote to self: we should probably use a plumbing command rather than \"git log\" in get_author_info().\n"

        "body": "@jrdavid: Cool that you want to work on this; here's some info to get you started:\n\nThe state of the imerge as a whole is stored in the `MergeState` object--_except_ for information about the micromerge that is currently in progress.  This is by design, because if the user aborts the merge or manually initiates another merge and then types `git-imerge continue`, git-imerge has to figure out how to proceed based on the state of the repo at that time, not the state of the repo the last time git-imerge ran.\n\nSo if you look at the code for 'continue', you will see that it calls `incorporate_user_merge()`, which is responsible for figuring out which micromerge (if any) was just finished by the user and recording the resolution in the MergeState object.\n\n`incorporate_user_merge()` finds the commit pointed at by the reference `refs/heads/imerge/NAME` and passes it to `MergeState.incorporate_manual_merge()`.  The latter checks that the commit is a merge, and if so looks for its parents among the micromerges that have been recorded previously and converts them into indexes:\n\n```\n(i1first, i2first) = self.find_index(parents[0])\n(i1second, i2second) = self.find_index(parents[1])\n```\n\nThis locates where the just-completed merge is located in the merge graph.  From there, it would be easy to output information about the original commits that are being merged, similar to what is done in `request_user_merge()`.\n\nHowever, the \"status\" command that you want to implement can't start from a merge commit, because the manual merge hasn't been done yet.  Instead it will have to find out, from Git, if a merge is currently in progress and if so, what two commits are being merged.  The first parent of an in-progress merge, of course, is stored in HEAD and can be determined via `git rev-parse HEAD`.  The second can be determined by reading the file `.git/MERGE_HEAD`, which, if it exists, lists the second \"HEAD\" of the in-progress merge.  (If the file doesn't exist, then no merge is in progress.  If the file has more than one line, then an octopus merge is in progress, in which case the \"status\" command would have to report that no micromerge is in progress).\n\nThen stick those two commit SHA-1s into `MergeState.find_index()`, to deduce which micromerge is in progress, and report the original log message using code like that in `request_user_merge()`.\n\nI hope that helps!  If you have any questions, don't hesitate to ask.\n"

        "body": "Cool, thanks for working on this!  It will be a nice feature.\n\nI belatedly realized that I was working on a topic branch that could help you with your \"status\" command (I just merged the topic branch to master): I added fields \"tip1\" and \"tip2\" to MergeState.  These record the names of the branches that are being merged, based on the user's arguments to \"git imerge start\", because I wanted to add that info to the suggested commit message when simplifying to a merge commit.  But you could use these fields instead of your get_refname() method, simplifying the code and potentially giving an answer that is more relevant to the user.  (Instead of computing and using `ref1` and `ref2`, simply use `merge_state.tip1` and `merge_state.tip2`.)\n\nI also think that the \"status\" command should work even if a conflicting merge is _not_ in progress.  For example, if the user has just run `git commit` to commit a conflict resolution, or has just run `git imerge record` to record the last conflict resolution without setting up the next one, then `git imerge status` could nevertheless say something useful about the current situation rather than just spitting out an error message.  It might even suggest the next command that the user might want to run.\n\nFinally, it looks like the implementation of \"status\" could share some code with `request_user_merge()`.\n\nAltogether very nice.  I look forward to the next iteration.  But please be patient; I will have spotty internet for the next week or so and might not be able to reply promptly.\n"

But this is incorrect, because A is an ancestor of B' (via B), which implies that the state B' includes the changes that were originally made in commit A.  But in fact, B' does _not_ include those changes; in the rebased commits, the changes originally introduced by A are only introduced in the delta from B' to A'.\n\nSo there is no way to preserve history when reordering commits while also preserving the correct commit ancestry.\n\n(It _is_ possible to use incremental-merge tricks to reorder history, and I hope to write that up soon.

        "body": "@myint, that's really cool!  I hadn't yet had the energy to get any of my projects running under Python3.  It's a lot less nasty than I would have feared.\n\nI just pushed some commits to master that incorporate some of the changes from your first commit. The remainder of your changes (i.e., after the already-merged changes have been removed) are in my repo under branch `myint/python3`.  But before I merge the rest, I would like to understand the ramifications a little bit better.\n\nWhat is the situation on the Mac OSX?  (Is that is what you are using?)  Is Python 2.x _unavailable_, or is it available, but just not under the name `python2`?  In other words, are these changes needed to make the script usable under Mac OSX at all, or just to avoid having to edit the shebang line?\n\n(If the latter, then there are other ways to make sure that a Python 2.x interpreter is used to run the script.  Either the script can be given a Shell preamble that chooses the correct Python interpreter, or we could add an install script that overwrites the shebang line with the one correct for the system that it is running on.  Not that python3 compatibility is something bad, but reducing the python2 compatibility might still be inconvenient for some users.)\n\nBefore these changes, I think that `git-imerge` would have worked under Python versions 2.5 <= version < 3.0 (though I haven't actually tested it against the older versions).  The changes I just pushed now prevent it from running under 2.5 (because it doesn't have the `next()` built-in function).  With the rest of your changes, what versions of Python should it run under?  Only 2.7 and 3.3?  Assuming that is the case, we should probably verify that the important recent OSs make one of these Python versions available.\n\nThanks again for your contribution!\n"

I happen to use Python 3 by default so my use case only tangentially relates to this issue (#18).\n\nI've enabled the Python 2.6 test on Travis CI (450e72831e09ceb4e312d0d07b035d7db870f697). It works. See test results [here](https://travis-ci.org/myint/git-imerge).\n\nI could enable Python 2.5 support, but the code will get a bit uglier. (The `as` exception syntax, which Python 3 requires, isn't supported in Python 2.5 and there are a few other things like what you mentioned.) And I think the trend in Python now is to support Python 2.6, 2.7, and 3.3.\n"

Now I see that it was backported to Python 2.6.1.\n\nSo if we merge your changes, I think our Python version requirement would become\n\n```\n(2.6.1 <= version < 3.0) or (3.3 <= version)\n```\n\n(that is, unless something else that you are using was introduced even later than 2.6.1).  I think we can live with that.  I just merged your change (though the commit identities have changed, so you might want to pull from me again).\n\nThanks!\n"

Any information that is host-specific [\u2026] is stored elsewhere.\n\nSection 4.8.2.1, page 21:\n\n> The `/usr/local` hierarchy is for use by the system administrator when installing software locally. [\u2026]\n> Locally installed software must be placed within /usr/local rather than /usr unless it is being installed to replace or upgrade software in `/usr`.\n\nI\u2019m not sure where to place `git-imerge` here. I guess that in a corporate environment, the sysadmin could place it in `/usr` (shared across all computers), but if a single user wanted it, he\u2019d put it in `/usr/local`?\n"

        "body": "I think it is clear that the choice of prefix depends on the context.  If `git-imerge` is picked up by any Linux distros, then they will install it to `/usr`.  If it is installed by a sysadmin for all of the users on a system, then `/usr/local`.  If it is installed by a single user of a multiuser system, then `$HOME`.  If Windows then presumably somewhere like\n\n```\nC:\\My Programs and Viruses and Keyloggers\\Cancer-Like Stuff\\Open Source\\\n```\n\n_All_ of these constituencies can be served because they can set `PREFIX` when installing.  The only question is: what is the conventional default?  I did a little bit of looking around, and it looks like my recollection that `/usr` is standard was incorrect.\n\nThe GNU Coding Standards (recommend)[http://www.gnu.org/prep/standards/html_node/Directory-Variables.html] setting the default prefix to `/usr/local`.  Autoconf (also uses `/usr/local`)[http://www.gnu.org/software/autoconf/manual/autoconf.html#Default-Prefix] as the default prefix.  I'm inclined to defer to them.\n\nGit's default install target [happens to be `$HOME`](https://github.com/git/git/blob/master/INSTALL), but I seen no special reason to imitate them.\n\nSo let's just wait a bit to see if @ralfth has any input, and then I'll merge.\n"

        "body": "OK I just pushed a tag 0.7.0.\n\nSorry I didn't get to this quicker, but really, we need more than just version tags and I was researching how best to do it.  But my research is taking longer than I'd hoped, so here is your tag.\n\nBeyond a version tag, there should be a mechanism for the script itself to know its version number, so that (for example) we can ask people who file a bug report to run `git-imerge --version` to be sure which version they were using.  It is a little bit awkward to do so based only on a Git tag.  Because on the one hand if the script is _not_ running from within a Git working copy, then you want it to be able to read the version directly from a file without going to the overhead of running Git.  But on the other hand, _if_ the script is running from within a Git working copy, then you want it to figure out the version of the current HEAD commit rather than use a version number from a file that might be stale.  But I don't want the process to rely on a \"build\" step that people (including me!) might forget.\n\nI think what I'd like to do is have the working copy version always try to get its version number from Git using [something like this](https://gist.github.com/dcreager/300803).  But at the _install_ step, the version number should be baked into the program somehow.  Maybe it could be as simple as using code like this:\n\n```\ntry:\n    from version_from_git import __version__\nexcept ImportError:\n    from version import __version__\n```\n\nThe source tree would have a file `version_from_git.py`, but that file would never be installed.  Instead, the installation process would generate a file `version.py` on the fly via something like\n\n```\nfrom version_from_git import __version__\nwith open('version.py', 'w') as f:\n    f.write('__version__ = %r\\n' % __version__)\n```\n\nThoughts?\n"

        "body": "I think this would be a cool feature to have.  Just to make sure Im on the same track.\n\nSay you have a history like so:\n\n```\no - A - B - C\n       \\  - D - E  - F - G - H\n```\n\nAnd I want to rebase G and beyond onto A,B,C:\n\n```\no - A - B - C - G' - H'\n       \\  - D - E - F \n```\n\nIn order to do this with git imerge, the following would need to happen:\n1. \"Remove\" commits before the first commit of the rebase but after the first common parent between the branch you are rebasing from and the branch you are rebasing onto, in this case (A).  In order to do this, iterate backwards.\n\n```\no - A   -   D   -  E   -   F   -   G   -   H\n                           |       |       |\n                           F\u207b\u00b9 -   G'  -   H''\n```\n\n```\no - A   -   D   -  E   -   F   -   G   -   H\n                   |       |       |       |\n                   |       F\u207b\u00b9 -   G'  -   H''\n                   |               |       | \n                   E\u207b\u00b9   ------    G''  -  H''\n```\n\n```\no - A   -   D   -  E   -   F   -   G   -   H\n            |      |       |       |       |\n            |      |       F\u207b\u00b9 -   G'  -   H''\n            |      |               |       |\n            |      E\u207b\u00b9 --------   G''  -   H''\n            |                     |        |\n            D\u207b\u00b9 ---------------- G'''  -  H'''\n```\n\nAnd possibly for completeness sake (although hopefully this last merge is a near noop)\n\n```\no - A   -   D   -  E   -   F   -   G    -   H\n    |       |      |       |       |        |\n    |       |      |      F\u207b\u00b9  -   G'   -   H''\n    |       |      |               |        |\n    |       |     E\u207b\u00b9   ------     G''  -   H''\n    |       |                      |        |\n    |      D\u207b\u00b9 ----------------    G''' -   H'''\n    |                              |        |\n    +----------------------------  G''''-   H''''   \n```\n\nAt this point, if you ignore the intermediate steps we have\n\n```\n       -  G'''' - H''''\n      /\no - A - B - C\n       \\\n         - D - E - F \n```\n\nNow, the problem has been reduced to a more simpler rebase at which git-imerge would essentially be rerun.\n\n```\no  -  A  -  B  -  C\n|                 |\nG''''             G'''''\n|                 |\nH'''' --------    H'''''\n```\n\nAnd we have our end result.   I suppose I would be interested in the kind of merge conflicts this procedure would uncover or if conflicts would seem redundant (i.e. slowly removing a piece of the code base). But maybe this redundancy is desired to ensure a smooth iterative process?\n\nAlso, would this same process work if you had merges in your branch to rebase from history?  I'm not sure how well git reverts merges...\n\nEdit:  Fixed diagrams and note to self to never try type ascii diagrams directly into github's text editor.\n"

        "body": "@muff1nman: I think that your \"remove commits\" steps can be done as a single incremental merge:\n\n```\no - A   -   D   -  E   -   F   -   G    -   H\n                           |\n                          F\u207b\u00b9\n                           |\n                          E\u207b\u00b9\n                           |\n                          D\u207b\u00b9\n```\n\nEach of these three revert commits (since they are applied in reverse order) necessarily applies cleanly.  For example, the state of the tree after `D\u207b\u00b9` is exactly the state of the tree after `A`.\n\nOnce the incremental merge is done:\n\n```\no - A   -   D   -  E   -   F   -   G    -   H\n                           |       |        |\n                          F\u207b\u00b9  -   G'   -   H'\n                           |       |        |\n                          E\u207b\u00b9  -   G''  -   H''\n                           |       |        |\n                          D\u207b\u00b9  -   G''' -   H'''\n```\n\nthen all you have to do is glue together the trees in the order `[A, G''', H''']` and you have effectively deleted `D`, `E`, and `F` from this history.\n\nThe second step, as you describe, is a standard `git imerge rebase`.\n\nBut you could even reduce these two steps to a single step, by starting the incremental merge like this:\n\n```\no - A   -   D   -  E   -   F   -   G    -   H\n                           |\n                          F\u207b\u00b9\n                           |\n                          E\u207b\u00b9\n                           |\n                          D\u207b\u00b9\n                           |\n                           B\n                           |\n                           C\n\n```\n\n`B` and `C` necessarily apply cleanly on top of `D\u207b\u00b9`, because `D\u207b\u00b9` has the same tree as `A`.  Once you've filled in the incremental merge\n\n```\no - A   -   D   -  E   -   F   -   G    -   H\n                           |       |        |\n                          F\u207b\u00b9  -   G\u2081   -   H\u2081\n                           |       |        |\n                          E\u207b\u00b9  -   G\u2082   -   H\u2082\n                           |       |        |\n                          D\u207b\u00b9  -   G\u2083   -   H\u2083\n                           |       |        |\n                           B   -   G\u2084   -   H\u2084\n                           |       |        |\n                           C   -   G\u2085   -   H\u2085\n\n```\n\nthe final answer is `[A, B, C, G\u2085, H\u2085]`.\n\nBut, even in this simple case, there is the question: is it more efficient to do it this way (remove `[D, E, F]` from the history and then rebase `[G\u2083, H\u2083]` onto `[A, B, C]`), or would it be more efficient to rebase `[D, E, F, G, H]` onto `[A, B, C]` and _then_ remove `[D', E', F']` from the result?  (Actually there are a bunch of other possibilities, too.)  That would be a straight rebase:\n\n```\no - A - B  - C\n    |   |    |\n    D - D\u2081 - D\u2082\n    |   |    |\n    E - E\u2081 - E\u2082\n    |   |    |\n    F - F\u2081 - F\u2082\n    |   |    |\n    G - G\u2081 - G\u2082\n    |   |    |\n    H - H\u2081 - H\u2082\n```\n\nfollowed by removal:\n\n```\no - A - B  - C - D\u2082 - E\u2082 - F\u2082   - G\u2082 - H\u2082\n                           |      |    |\n                           F\u2082\u207b\u00b9 - G\u2083 - H\u2083\n                           |      |    |\n                           E\u2082\u207b\u00b9 - G\u2084 - H\u2084\n                           |      |    |\n                           D\u2082\u207b\u00b9 - G\u2085 - H\u2085\n```\n\nThen the answer is `[A, B, C, G\u2085, H\u2085]`.\n\nI don't think that these two methods are equivalent.  Which one is easier probably depends on a case-by-case basis.\n"

How is this done in the usual git-imerge case of a merge?  I.e. going from:\n\n```\nA - B - C\n|   |   |\nD - D'- D''\n|   |   |\nE - E'- E''\n```\n\nto\n\n```\nA - B - C\n|       |\nD       |\n|       |\nE - - - M\n```\n\nThe possiblity for different methods is not something I thought of before and\nideally I think it would be cool for the user to choose a method.  For now, however, I think the first option presents a more logical progression of merging.\n"

There are only very few `git` commands that have an interactive component, so this approach was unexpected.  It would also effectively make `git-imerge` unusable from a script.\n\nI think my preference would be for the program to emit an error message listing the merge bases (which you have already implemented) but then just abort.  And for there to be a new command-line option like `--merge-base=SHA1` to let the user specify an explicit merge base at his next attempt.  It is a little bit more work for the user, but it is more consistent with the rest of the interface (and with that of Git itself).\n"

        "body": "Sorry for the delay, but these things require a good contiguous block of time to think about and I've been pretty busy with GSoC.\n\nLet me think out loud about what `git-imerge` is doing in your case.\n\nJust after the conflict at 4-2 has been resolved, the diagram looks like this:\n\n```\n 0123456\n0*******\n1*.?..-+\n2*.?.*??\n3*.?.???\n4*.?.???\n5*.?|???\n6*--+???\n```\n\nThere are two \"blocker blocks\" on the frontier: a two-column block whose upper-left corner is at 3-2, and a two-row block at 4-1.  (Remember: the way a block is defined, its left and top edges must consist of known merges.)\n\nThe algorithm proceeds by picking one of these blocks and trying to complete its outline (its right and bottom edges).  It always works on the leftmost blocker block first, because that results in less jumping around and is thus hopefully less confusing for the user.  So it tries to fill the two-row block starting at 3-2 using bisection.  It finds that merge 4-5 is the first one in that block (i.e., in column 4) that still fails.  Now we have\n\n```\n 0123456\n0*******\n1*.?..-+\n2*.?.*??\n3*.?.|??\n4*.?.+??\n5*.?|#??\n6*--+???\n```\n\nThen it proceeds to the other blocking block at 4-1.  You say you wish that it would first try 6-4, because in your scenario that merge would have succeeded.  But what it actually does is bisect column 5, determining that 5-4 is mergeable, and _then_ proceed to 6-4.  So in your mind it should optimistically attempt 6-4, and only if that fails go back to 5-4.  In your case this would save one test merge, namely the one at 5-4.  Correct?\n\nIf I understand correctly, your suggestion doesn't actually have anything particular to do with filling after a blocker has been manually merged.  It could just as well be applied at the beginning of the incremental merge.  As an example, take the test merge that is run by `t/test-unconflicted`:\n\n```\n 012345678\n0*********\n1*........\n2*........\n3*........\n4*........\n5*........\n\nAttempting automerge of 1-1...success.\nAttempting automerge of 1-4...success.\nAttempting automerge of 1-5...success.\nAttempting automerge of 8-5...success.\n```\n\nBy the way, this algorithm is located in [`MergeFrontier.compute_by_bisection()`](https://github.com/mhagger/git-imerge/blob/master/git-imerge#L846-L980).\n\nCurrently, `git-imerge` first tests 1-1 (i.e., on the pessimistic guess that maybe the whole block is unmergeable).  Then it bisects column 1, determining that the whole column is mergeable.  Then it jumps straight to 8-5, and thereby determines that the whole block is mergeable.\n\nIf you ask me, a better sequence of tests should be:\n1. Check 1-1, to see if the whole block is unmergeable.  If this merge fails, we're done.\n2. Check 8-5, to see if the whole block is mergeable.  If this merge succeeds, we're done.\n3. Check 1-5, to see if the whole first row is mergeable.  If this merge succeeds, then proceed to bisect the fifth row (but remembering that 8-5 is already known to fail).\n4. Otherwise, bisect the first column, remembering that 1-5 fails.\n\nDo you agree?  It is similar to the optimization that is already done [here](https://github.com/mhagger/git-imerge/blob/master/git-imerge#L944) and [here](https://github.com/mhagger/git-imerge/blob/master/git-imerge#L971), and it shouldn't be that difficult to implement.\n\nIt is not _certain_ that it will save work; it depends on how often the optimistic check of the bottom-right corner succeeds.  But I guess that you are right that it will win more often than lose.  And testing the bottom of the first column before starting the bisection of that column is probably also a win.\n"

Do you already have some code that you are willing to share with us?\n\nThe obvious place to wire in a test would be in `automerge()`, though I haven't thought through whether it is as simple as that.\n\nBut I think that building and/or running tests will make the test merges so expensive that other inefficiencies will become very annoying (as for example you observed in issue #59).  For example, presumably the build/test would be run during the test merges (e.g., the ones made during bisection), and then when autofilling the same merges are done (albeit from different parents).  But, as long as the tree SHA-1s match, there is no reason to run the same build/tests again.  For example, one could keep a record of trees that have tested OK, and if the same tree reappears, just assume that it is still OK.\n"

Aside from @johnkeeping's patch (or something like it), I guess we would need a new option for the user to use to specify to the test command.  The test command should probably be stored as a string to the git config and executed using the shell.  And we might want to handle test command failures different than merge conflicts; perhaps there should be two separate exceptions, both derived from `AutomaticMergeFailed` but that emit different error messages.\n"

        "body": "Yes, I think the command should be stored using `git config`.  (Of course by that I don't mean the user should have to type `git config` herself/himself!)\n\nIt would be wrong to store the command choice in the git repository in the imerge state blob, because (especially when we better support collaborations on imerges) it should not be possible for one user to cause another user to execute an arbitrary command (security risk).  And it could very well be that different users want to run different commands for testing, or that their differing local environments require the commands to be run differently.\n\nBut we can nevertheless store it in a part of the configuration specific to a particular imerge:\n\n```\n[imerge \"myname\"]\n        testCommand = \"make -j16 test\"\n```\n\nWe might also offer a default setting that is used if there is no setting for a particular imerge (because, realistically, the command will probably be the same for different imerge runs within the same repository):\n\n```\n[imerge]\n        testCommand = \"make -j16 test\"\n```\n\nIf imerge were the only program involved, I'd stop there.  But I've had a few ideas about how various commands could use tests.  For example, `git bisect` can use a test, `pre-commit` hooks might want to run tests, one or two scripts of my own sometimes want to run tests.  So I've been thinking that it would be nice to have a way to specify tests more abstractly within a repository and refer to them from different commands.  Think of something like\n\n```\n[test \"build\"]\n        command = make -j8\n[test \"fresh\"]\n        # These commands would be run in sequence; all must succeed:\n        command = git clean -dfx\n        command = make configure\n        command = ./configure --prefix=$HOME\n        command = make -j8\n[test \"full\"]\n        command = ionice -c 3 make -j8 test\n[test]\n        default = build\n[imerge \"myname\"]\n        test = full\n```\n\nMaybe there should even be a new command, `git test`, that runs tests that are configured in this way and memoizes the results (e.g., in git notes) for trees that have been tested.\n"

Isn't `str('GIT_IMERGE')` identical to `'GIT_IMERGE'` on all Python versions, and the same for `'1'`?  For example, for Python 2.7 and Python 3.3:\n\n```\n$ python2\nPython 2.7.6 (default, Mar 22 2014, 15:40:47) \n[GCC 4.8.2] on linux2\nType \"help\", \"copyright\", \"credits\" or \"license\" for more information.\n>>> str('1') is '1', str('GIT_IMERGE') is 'GIT_IMERGE'\n(True, True)\n>>> \n$ python3\nPython 3.3.5 (default, Mar 22 2014, 13:24:53) \n[GCC 4.8.2] on linux\nType \"help\", \"copyright\", \"credits\" or \"license\" for more information.\n>>> str('1') is '1', str('GIT_IMERGE') is 'GIT_IMERGE'\n(True, True)\n>>> \n```\n\nI don't have a Windows machine for testing, but I can't imagine that the results are different.

I assume it must be Python 2.x because otherwise the output of `check_output()` (which is already unicode) need never be encoded to a byte string.\n\nI have Python 2.7 and Python 3.3 handy so let's consider those:\n\n|  | Python 2.7 | Python 3.3 |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| `check_output()` | returns `unicode` | returns `unicode` |\n| `str(a[0])` | returns `bytes` | returns `unicode` |\n| `env[k] = v` on Linux/Mac | `k` and `v` must be `bytes` | `k` and `v` must be `unicode`; encoded/decoded to `filesystemencoding` using `surrogateescape` |\n| `env[k] = v` on Windows | `k` and `v` must be `bytes` | `k` and `v` must be `unicode`; passed directly to `putenv` as `unicode` |\n\nSo `str()` is failing, because the author name includes Unicode, but `str()` is only capable of decoding ASCII.  Somewhere between `check_output()` and `os.environ` we need an honest-to-goodness encoding of the string to `PREFERRED_ENCODING`.\n\nBut we _don't_ want this encoding for Python 3.x, because its `os.environ` expects to work with Unicode strings.\n\nI just pushed up a branch `issue-62` that I think will fix this problem.  Please test it and let me know if it works for you.\n"

        "body": "First of all, thanks for the patch and I'd like to apologize for not reacting to your old issue #40.\n\nI like the idea of your change, but I have a couple of comments:\n1.  It is inappropriate for `get_boundaries()` to call `sys.exit()`.  Instead, it should raise an exception, and the callers should catch the exception and handle it appropriately.  I suggest something like\n   \n   ```\n   class NothingToDoError(Failure):\n       pass\n   ```\n   \n   and then have those two cases raise this exception instead of a plain-old `Failure`.  (This change will also make the following change easier.)\n2.  I agree that `git imerge merge` and `git imerge rebase` should treat these scenarios as non-errors (essentially mimicking the behavior of `git merge` and `git rebase`, respectively).  But I'm less sure about the other callers, namely `git imerge init` and `git imerge start`.  If I run one of those commands, then it feels a little bit more like my intent is specifically to start an incremental merge as opposed to accomplish a merge/rebase.  From that point of view, failure to end up in an \"I am now doing an incremental merge\" state could be seen as an error.  So I suggest that you change the `git imerge merge` and `git imerge rebase` callers to catch `NothingToDoError` and ideally to output the exact same diagnostic messages as would `git merge` and `git rebase`.  But I would leave the other two callers unchanged, so that they continue to exit with error messages and error status.\n\nWhat do you think?\n"

The merges themselves should be pretty trivial, assuming your project doesn't change the world in each commit.  So if these \"autofills\" take a second each, then it is probably because your source tree is so large that even trivial operations like \"git status\" take a long time.  Am I guessing correctly?\n\nIt is possible to do such merges directly in the index, which I would expect would speed them up considerably.  It hasn't been a pain point for me yet so I haven't implemented it, but I think it should be pretty straightforward.  I think it would involve the commands `git read-tree -i -m --aggressive`, `git merge-index git-merge-one-file -a`, `git write-tree`, and `git commit-tree`, but the trick is getting the details right of creating a temporary index (maybe not needed?), handling temporary files, and restoring everything to a sane state when done.\n\nIt would be helpful to a lot of people if you want to work on this.\n"

        "body": "@dleen: Let me add some thoughts here, since there is already information here about the hoped-for feature.\n\nFirst of all, it seems to me that there are two cases where we have to deal with \"empty\" conflict resolutions:\n1.  The user recognizes that he wants to skip a commit and types a special command like `git imerge skip`.\n2.  The user types `git imerge continue` with no changes in the working copy but with an in-progress merge that hasn't been committed.  Normally we commit the user's `git add`ed changes for him, so in this case we should also commit the NOP merge.  We would have to recognize this situation--the special scratch refname is checked out, a merge is in progress, but there are no staged changes.  (It might be that we don't have to care whether there are staged changes and could just pass the `--allow-empty` argument all the time.)\n\nIn either case we would want to create an empty commit for the user as a placeholder in the incremental merge to keep it a nice grid.\n\nThe next step is that when simplifying such a merge into a rebase, we should also avoid carrying empty commits over into the result.  So there would have to be some logic in the `simplify` and `finish` subcommands to decide when one of the commits should be omitted.\n"

But see my comment above where I express skepticism about whether this memoization is the correct approach. Another unfortunate side-effect of your memoization approach is that `GitConfigStore` cannot be used as a normal class; for example, if there were a reason to add static methods to the class, it would be impossible to access them.\n\nIn summary: I like the idea of having a class for interfacing with `git config`, but I think that the level of complication could be dialed back a notch or two unless/until we need it.\n"

The time above is just the time until it presents the first conflict, which involves a few hundred autofills.\n\nWith both versions it seems most of the process is CPU bound, at least on linux with an SSD.

But it would be a shame to burden everybody with the cost of running Git three times to get this information, **especially** under Windows where it is so expensive to start a subprocess.\n\nSo I propose #73 as an alternative to your approach. Does it work for you?\n\nBy the way, do you know where this fails when using msysgit? Does their `git.exe` simply not output data past the first NUL character? (If so, it would be worth reporting a bug to that project, because I presume many scripts rely on this sort of thing.) Or is it that data are lost somewhere between git and `subprocess.Popen()`? Or is our implementation of `check_output()` incorrect?\n"

        "body": "@ggascoigne: I'm sure this response is too late for you :disappointed:, but maybe it will be helpful for other people in the future.\n\nWhen you run `git imerge continue`, it looks at the `HEAD` commit to see if it can be incorporated into the current imerge. It does this by looking at its two parents and checking whether they are two commits that currently need manual merging.\n\nSo, suppose imerge left the repo in the following state:\n\n```\no---0---1---2---3\n    |   |   |\n    A---o---X\n    |   |   |\n    B---Y---?\n    |\n    C\n```\n\nIt expected you to fill in the merge at `?` by merging `X` and `Y` directly, but instead (if I understand correctly) you did the merge via a helper commit `H`, maybe like:\n\n```\no---0---1---2---3\n    |   |   |\n    A---o---X\n    |   |   |\n    B---Y-H-M\n    |\n    C\n```\n\nAt this point `git imerge continue` fails for you, because one of the parents of your final merge `M` is the helper commit `H`, which is unknown to imerge. Therefore it doesn't recognize that `M` can be used as the merge between `X` and `Y`.\n\nFortunately, the solution isn't that difficult. You need to adjust the parents of `M` to be `X` and `Y` without changing its tree contents. You can do that using a handy-dandy command that I built into imerge even though it doesn't really fit there:\n\n```\ngit reset --hard $(git imerge reparent X Y)\n```\n\nThis essentially squashes commit `H` into `M`, making the repo look like\n\n```\no---0---1---2---3\n    |   |   |\n    A---o---X\n    |   |   |\n    B---Y---M'\n    |\n    C\n```\n\nNow `git imerge continue` should work.\n\nIt would be nice to make this easier. For example, we could check whether the `HEAD` commit has only two ancestors that are on the frontier of the merge and no ancestors that are not on the frontier. If so, we could check whether the merge of those two parents is needed, and if so, do essentially what I described above. But I would be a little bit worried that we were throwing away useful work done by the user. For example, what if you wrote a careful commit message for commit `H` explaining what you were changing and why it was necessary? You might be upset to have it discarded.\n\nOn an even deeper level, I wonder if your commit `H` would be useful for the continuation of the imerge? For example, when it comes time, in the next row, to fill in this `?`:\n\n```\no---0---1---2---3\n    |   |   |\n    A---o---X\n    |   |   |\n    B---Y-H-M\n    |   |   |\n    C---T---?\n```\n\nit might actually be easier to first compute the merge of `H` and `T`, and then compute the merge of `M` and `U`:\n\n```\no---0---1---2---3\n    |   |   |\n    A---o---X\n    |   |   |\n    B---Y-H-M\n    |   | | |\n    C---T-U-?\n```\n\nI think this is a promising idea, though I'm not sure if it generalizes. It would be quite a lot of work to build it into `git imerge`, because a lot of the code assumes a \"rectangular grid\" topology of commits and merges.\n"

The fact that this choice is made as a side effect of other commands doesn't change that fact.\n\nI wouldn't want to invent an extra file just to hold that one little bit of information.\n\nWhat I _can_ imagine would be not to set `imerge.default` so eagerly. After all, if there is only a single imerge in progress (by far the most common case), it is not really useful. Even if the user has two imerges going at once, it is often clear which one is intended:\n- From the `--name=NAME` option\n- From the name of the current branch (if it is one of the temporary names that imerge sets up).\n\nWe could add a command `git imerge set-default NAME` to let the user choose a default branch explicitly (or just let the user run `git config imerge.default NAME`), and otherwise leave that setting alone.\n"

        "body": "Hi @waldyrious!\n\n> [...] I was wondering whether creating this kind of helper commits could be automatically managed by git-imerge, i.e.: whenever git-imerge finds a conflict, it could be that the commits aren't modular enough, so what if it tried splitting the involved commits using the same splitting method used in `git add -p`? Maybe then the merge could proceed automatically, rather than the user explicitly creating commit `H` as in your example above (unless I misunderstood and you meant the commit would be created automatically?).\n\nIt is approximately true that a merge only fails if there is a conflict _within_ a single hunk of the diff. Since `git add -p` works hunk by hunk, it wouldn't be able to subdivide the conflict in any useful way.\n\n> Another question I had was whether using a different merge algorithm (Patience, Diff Match and Patch, maybe others?) could be used as an attempt to automatically resolve conflicts that the default diff algorithm fails to deal with. But this is probably worth a separate issue, if at all (let me know).\n\n`git-imerge` doesn't actually do any merges or resolve any conflicts itself. It relies on `git merge` to do so. So to choose a different merge algorithm, we would basically need to pass the corresponding options down to `git merge`, I think. It seems like a reasonable thing to implement, though it is pretty much unrelated to this issue. The main question is what the user interface should look like. Would the user choose a different merge algorithm as part of their permanent config, or at the start of an imerge session, or for one particular micromerge, or ...?\n\nI don't use other merge strategies, so this wouldn't be high on my own priority list. But patches are welcome :-)\n"

So the `H` commit you're talking about would be manually created, and in a non-trivial way, I suppose?\n\n> It seems like a reasonable thing to implement, though it is pretty much unrelated to this issue.\n\nYes, sorry, it was silly of me to tack that into this issue. Anyway, I was thinking about `git-imerge` automatically trying different options to git-merge in case it finds a conflict with the default option, in the hopes that some of those could solve the issue. I have no idea whether that would be likely to make a difference, though.\n\nHaving explicit options for the user would be a nice extra, but I'm not sure that would be particularly useful or elegant, unless the user could predict which diffing algorithm would work best for their merge, and I assume most people aren't prepared to do that. Therefore, if there is to be any trial-and-error, I'd rather have the computer do it than myself.\n"

Also the output of running `git config --list` in that repository (but scrub any passwords if present).\n\nIf you are not using the most recent version of git-imerge or are using an older Git version, it might be worth an attempt with updated software.\n\nIt is very curious that the failure point is not reproducible. I don't think that any information should carry over from one attempt to run `git imerge merge` and the next. Theoretically `git rerere` could do so, but I think `git-imerge` always turns it off before running `git`. (If you haven't disabled rerere, that would be worth an experiment: before running `imerge`, run\n\n```\ngit config rerere.enabled false\n```\n\nand see if the error either goes away or becomes more consistently reproducible.)\n\nThe commits in question seem to involve a lot of file creation and deletion. Perhaps filename case normalization is turned on and is confusing things (e.g., if you are running this on OSX)?\n"

        "body": "I doubt that parallelizing the autofilling of a single block would bring more than a factor of two in speed, and even that would usually not be attained. Why?\n\nAutofilling (or in general the actions that happen when you type `git imerge continue`) involves two things:\n1. A series of binary searches to find the frontier. A single binary search is not very parallelizable, because you don't know which side to bisect next until you know the result of the current bisection. I suppose you could bisect both sides, basically doing three tests at a time (or more generally `n` tests at a time) to divide the range into `n+1` subranges. But that costs `n` times as much work and only saves you `lg((n+1)/2)` bisection steps. So for example it would take 3x as much work at each step to half the bisection time, or 7x as much work to quarter it. So the benefit doesn't scale very well.\n   \n   In fact, we are really doing a kind of 2D bisection, and it might be possible to gain another factor of at most 2 by working on both ends of the merge frontier simultaneously. (See [this blog post](http://softwareswirl.blogspot.de/2012/12/mapping-merge-conflict-frontier.html) for a description of the algorithm.)\n   \n   But I don't think the bisection step is usually the bottleneck anyway, because it is typically a few times `O(lg max(M,N))`\n2. A series of merges to fill in the commits along the frontier. Each edge kindof has to be done one commit at a time, because each commit has its predecessor as parent. You could do the two edges of a block simultaneously then check that the apex commits agree, would gain you a factor of `(M + N) / max(M,N)`, where `M` and `N` are the lengths of the two edges of the block. In the best case, this would be a factor of two. But [more typically](http://softwareswirl.blogspot.de/2012/12/real-world-conflict-diagrams.html), the blocks are long and skinny, so `(M + N)` is not much larger than `max(M,N)`.\n   \n   You **could** compute an arbitrary number of edge merges simultaneously _if you assume that merging two distant commits gives the same result as merging incrementally_. You would actually compute the trees in parallel, then at the end create commits from the trees, stringing them together in the correct parent-child relationships.\n   \n   But the assumption in the previous paragraph makes me a little bit nervous. It should _usually_ be true (after all, it is the basis of the bisection algorithm that we use). But in practice it could easily be that there are differences. We currently check for these differences by doing the incremental merges along each edge then comparing the trees of the apex commits to make sure they are identical. But if we used this parallelization approach we wouldn't have nearly as strong a consistency check that the merges had mutually-consistent results.\n\nAnother place that could be parallelized would be when there are multiple blocks that need autofilling at the same time. Usually when there is a conflict, there are two blocks that need autofilling. There might be another factor (of at most two) to be gained by filling the two blocks at the same time. But this is also a bit awkward, because one of the blocks sits on top of the other, like this:\n\n```\n**********\n*..|.....|\n*..|-----+\n*..|#?????\n*..|??????\n*..|??????\n*--+??????\n```\n\nSo the block on the upper-right can't be autofilled until at least the first two commits on the vertical edge of the block on the left are computed. Also, if there is a conflict at the apex of the block on the left, then those two commits are called into question (though this is hopefully a rare occurrence).\n\nSo all in all I don't think autofilling can be parallized very well (I guess typically by a factor of less than two), unless you are willing to rely for correctness on the assumption written in italics above.\n"

        "body": "For the particular case when the rectangle is very long and narrow, I think we could get far better gains by changing filling strategy. For example, in the diagram below suppose that we are trying to rebase the vertical branch on top of the horizontal branch, and we find the conflict marked with `#`:\n\n```\n***************************************************************************\n*..........................................................................\n*..........................................................................\n*................#.........................................................\n*..........................................................................\n*..........................................................................\n*..........................................................................\n```\n\nWe currently autofill two blocks by computing all of the commits shown as `x` here:\n\n```\n***************************************************************************\n*...............x.........................................................x\n*...............xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx\n*...............x#.........................................................\n*...............x..........................................................\n*...............x..........................................................\n*xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx..........................................................\n```\n\nNote that it is the two long, horizontal edges that are expensive. The vertical edges are relatively cheap because the vertical dimension is so much shorter than the horizontal.\n\nWhat if, instead, we computed the following:\n\n```\n***************************************************************************\n*...............xx.........................................................\n*...............xx.........................................................\n*...............x#.........................................................\n*...............x..........................................................\n*...............x..........................................................\n*...............x..........................................................\n```\n\nThis is enough to let the user resolve the conflict at `#`. Then we could continue autofilling that column in the vertical direction:\n\n```\n***************************************************************************\n*...............xx.........................................................\n*...............xx.........................................................\n*...............x#.........................................................\n*...............xx.........................................................\n*...............xx.........................................................\n*...............xx.........................................................\n```\n\nWe have effectively rebased the vertical branch over to the right, thereby moving past a commit on the horizontal branch that conflicted with it. We could continue from there by looking for the next conflict.\n\nThe advantage of this approach is that we only have to compute `O(min(M,N))` commits, rather than `O(M + N)`. If `M` and `N` have very different sizes, this is a dramatic improvement. A disadvantage is that we lose the apex consistency check that I mentioned earlier, though we could still do a consistency check between the incrementally computed apex commit and the apex commit computed directly.\n\nOf course this only works if our goal is to merge or to rebase the vertical branch on top of the horizontal branch. If our goal is to rebase the horizontal branch on top of the vertical branch, then there is no way around computing the merges on the bottom edge of the diagram. But even in this case, we could avoid computing _additional_ horizontal lines in the diagram.\n\nThis approach seems very promising.\n"

If I were doing a plain\ngit rebase I would just have to do it again. But with git-imerge I had the correct rebase results\nalso done only there was no command to access the other one...\n"

        "body": "@bozzzzo: Thanks for the explanation. That makes sense and I can see that it would be a useful feature.\n\nRegarding the patch itself:\n1. It is an awful lot of copy-paste. I think it makes sense to extract some functions first to reduce the amount of duplication. I just pushed a branch `simplify-to-path` in PR #90 that does so. If I then merge that branch into yours, the result is my `rebase-reversed` branch (though I haven't tested it at all).\n2. The new feature would need documentation in [`README.rst`](https://github.com/mhagger/git-imerge/blob/master/README.rst).\n3. There are some consistency checks done for rebases (for example, [here](https://github.com/mhagger/git-imerge/blob/39bd36d861193685dabc6be54c132c70416fdc75/git-imerge#L1993-L1994) and [here](https://github.com/mhagger/git-imerge/blob/39bd36d861193685dabc6be54c132c70416fdc75/git-imerge#L2222-L2225) which I think would also be needed for `rebase-reversed`.\n4. Given that `--goal=rebase` is actually kindof reversed relative to what `git rebase` does, I wonder whether naming this feature `rebase-reversed` will introduce even more confusion. I wonder if a better name might make this clearer. At the same time we might even want to deprecate `--goal=rebase` and give that operation a more intuitive name, too.\n"

        "body": "@kastiglione: the code that defines/implements the filling strategy is a bit scattered around, but there is a precedent for variations in strategy influenced by the `--goal=GOAL` and `--manual` options. Let me do a brain dump of code that is related to the strategy:\n- `Block.auto_expand_frontier` currently is the main point for deciding between strategies for auto-filling and auto-expanding the frontier.\n- `MergeFrontier.map_known_frontier` only considers a block to be within the frontier if its right _and_ bottom edges are both known. This requirement would have to be relaxed in the case of the new strategy.\n- `MergeFrontier.auto_expand` probably doesn't care much about strategy itself, though it recurses into `Block.auto_expand_frontier`.\n- `Block.auto_outline` fills in the right and bottom edges of the block.\n- `Block.auto_outline_frontier` implements the usual default strategy.\n- `MergeState.auto_complete_frontier` probably also doesn't need to care about strategy.\n- `MergeState.simplify_to_rebase` has a consistency check (the `if not force` block) that I think would have to be skipped in the case of the new strategy.\n\nIdeally, as part of this change, the choice of strategy would be more decoupled from the rest of the classes. But that might be overkill.\n\nLet me know if you have any other questions.\n"

        "body": "You mean a PR with appropriate changes to readme?\n\nAnyways, git-imerge works by creating separate branches for its operation and commits to those. It does not touch the original branches until it is 100% done merging. Apparently `git-imerge remove` is the command to simply remove the branches created by git-imerge, but if you do it mid-merge, HEAD might remain pointing to some commit created by git-imerge even though that commit is no longer on any branch (i.e. detached HEAD). This is **very** visible if you use a visual tool that displays the commit graph (because you see the entire \"fan\" of git-imerge's intermediate merge commits leading up to the commit pointed to by HEAD), but once you check out your original branch (the one you were on when you started git-imerge), those commits will likely be gone from the commit graph because they will no longer be referenced by anything.\n"

Would it then be `git-imerge remove` then `git checkout <original branch>`?\n\nI suppose this should go in the \"[Suspending/resuming](https://github.com/mhagger/git-imerge#suspendingresuming)\" section (whose title could have \"/aborting\" appended), but should that text be reworked as well?\n\nLast time I tried using this on a huge, nasty conflict (line-ending changes across multiple files interfering with changes on those files), I eventually decided to give up, but the instructions on that section got me into an even worse (so I thought) state. I can't recall the details exactly, but I believe I tried resolving a manual merge, committing (per the instructions git-imerge gave me), then I decided to back off by doing `git merge --abort`; but then the tree was all messed up, and `git imerge continue` gave me an error message about commits not having the right parents, IIRC. Of course, this is only tangentially related, and probably my fault, so if the text there looks good and unambiguous to you, let's just add the extra paragraph about completely aborting the incremental merge.\n"

In fact, your problem seems to be that `git-imerge` legitimately can't handle merging/rebasing from one branch point to another if those commits are not connected by a chain of `--first-parent` ancestry. This is currently a limitation of `git-imerge` that could probably be relaxed under some circumstances. I'll reopen this issue as an enhancement request.\n"

I did a tiny bit of manual testing, but this is an important spot in the code that is used for all imerges (not only in the case that the merge-base is not a first-parent ancestor of the branch tips). If somebody could do more careful testing that #111 hasn't broken anything, or even better, improve the test suite to verify the current code and catch any similar new regressions in the future, that would be a great help towards getting this fix merged and in general improving the quality of `git-imerge`. Anyone? :pray:\n"

But the installation complications pointed out by `orao` will certainly be a headache for users, especially Windows users.\n\nIt might not be crazy to support both backends by creating a virtual interface to the Git repository, and choosing either the Git or the libgit2 version at runtime. That would allow anybody to try out the script easily, then if performance is a problem and the user is competent to do so, they can install libgit2 and the Python bindings to speed things up.\n\nSuch a virtual interface might also be useful for testing `git-imerge`. One could create a mock Git repository for `git-imerge` to interact with. The mock could simulate scenarios that are awkward and fiddly to construct in a real Git repository, such as conflicts in specified patterns, or merges that first appear to succeed, but then conflict when done incrementally.\n\nBut I don't expect to have time to work on any of this in the near future.\n"

Since there is no such manpage, it doesn't work.\n\n`git-imerge --help` invokes the `git-imerge` script itself, which asks `argparse` to generate help output based on the command-line options and their help strings, plus the file comment `__doc__`.\n\nI don't think this is easy to fix, short of somebody writing a manpage for `git-imerge`. This, in turn, might be done by getting `argparse` to emit its output in TROFF format. I did something similar for the `cvs2svn` project, but haven't had time to do that yet here. Maybe `argparse` supports a standard way of doing this?\n"

Yes, there must have been a byte `\\xe2` somewhere in the commit that it was trying to process, probably in either the log message or in the author/committer name. It appears that `imerge` was trying to encode this use the `ascii` encoding. Since `\\xe2` is not a valid ASCII character, :boom:\n\nSo one question is the one you posed: \"Why doesn't `imerge` handle data as binary?\" It probably should, though it's a pain to do so in Python, especially while retaining compatibility between Python 2 and Python 3. So that might be a nice long-term goal but is unlikely to happen soon.\n\nA simpler question, and one that might solve your current difficulties, is \"Why is `imerge` using the `ascii` encoding on your system?\" This comes from `PREFERRED_ENCODING`, which comes from the standard Python library function `locale.getpreferredencoding()`. This function accesses your environment to guess what locale to use.\n\nSince the most common encoding used in Git metadata is UTF-8, I suggest that you try running the last command again as follows:\n\n```\nexport LANG=en_US.utf8\ngit imerge finish\n```\n\nand see if that helps. (If not, see what you have to do on your system to affect the locale.)\n\nAlternatively, you can edit the `git-imerge` script by hand to set `PREFERRED_ENCODING` near the top of the script manually, for example like\n\n```\nPREFERRED_ENCODING = 'UTF-8'\n```\n\nIf none of that helps, please tell us what repository you are working on and what SHA-1 you are trying to merge so that we can reproduce the problem.\n"

Do all of the NxM merges have to be computed ahead of time, can't we compute them lazily?  Once the bisect has shown that revision A of mine conflicts with B from upstream, we already (via the binary search) know that A-1 merges cleanly with B and B-1 merges cleanly with A, so can't we just do the B-1, A-1 merge, then merge B and A into that and then try to merge those two, rather than computing all of the intermediate steps that are never used?"

I'm curious to what extent your merge is so slow simply because it is gigantic, vs. whether you are hitting a pathological case. I suspect the latter.\r\n\r\nThese `UnexpectedMergeFailure` exceptions are meant to be just that, unexpected. They occur when it is possible to merge a whole series of commits together, but then when it tries to merge the commits one by one, there is a failure somewhere along the way. In other words, your merge is violating [this approximate assumption](https://github.com/mhagger/git-imerge/blob/master/git-imerge#L985-L987).\r\n\r\nThe backtracking that you see is `git-imerge`'s way of recovering. Because this is expected to be an unusual occurrence, this code path is not written in a way that would be appropriate if it were expected that the assumption would be violated not a few times, but more than ~1000 times.\r\n\r\nThe repeated backtracking that you see, I believe, is the very first step of outlining a block of commits that are all expected to be doable. This is the merge of one commit from one side of the block with all of the commits on the other side of the block. When that merge unexpectedly fails, it takes only one step backwards and tries again. It is quite possible that this is making the overall algorithm regress to O(N\u00b2) or something.\r\n\r\nYour \"ugly\" fix is pretty much what my first impulse would have been (though probably with a custom exception type built for this purpose). Feel free to write it up as a PR. But additionally, I hypothesize that an algorithmic improvement could reduce your pain dramatically. For example, `MergeFrontier.remove_failure` could do a bisection step to more quickly find a less ambitious merge that succeeds.\r\n\r\nI'm really curious to hear whether your merge was/will be successful eventually.\r\n"

        "body": "The merge did succeed last night.  It looks as if I'd missed some commit markers in one of the previous merges and so the next one ended up being nonsense and git-imerge gave up because of this.  Backtracking around 2000 upstream revisions undid this error and let me fix it properly (well, in a way that didn't conflict - I need to wait for the LLVM merge to finish before I can tell whether it's actually working).  The backtracking took about 45 minutes, which was not that bad in comparison to a merge that took two and a half weeks overall.  Almost all of this time is spent autofilling, and so anything that could reduce the number of those that are done would help a lot.  It would also possibly help if git-imerge could time the pairwise merges and run git gc periodically if the time has increased a lot.  I've found that it creeps from about 2 seconds to about 30 seconds in the larger merge and then drops down a lot after a gc.  The gc isn't deleting much, but the compression stage appears to dramatically reduce the amount of I/O the git processes do (and means that they're sitting at 100% CPU usage, rather than mostly blocked on I/O, even with a fast SSD).

        "body": "@davidchisnall: The complication with your idea is that any skipped merge that supposedly should be conflict-free can actually turn out to conflict (for example, if a commit was reverted on one of the branches). In this case some backtracking is necessary. The backtracking can end up requiring the user to do a manual merge that should really be an ancestor of `(A, B)`. It's not impossible, but the bookkeeping becomes pretty arduous, and it would sometimes require manual merges to be done out of order, which I think would be very confusing to users. Moreover, the details of how the user resolves the \"later\" conflict then later resolves the \"earlier\" conflict might differ in detail, resulting in more confusion.\r\n\r\nIf we were willing to lean more on [these assumptions](https://github.com/mhagger/git-imerge/blob/5951fad2945814930374cf0967d3f6b4c050b112/git-imerge#L1328-L1339) and accept some potentially very awkward effects when the assumptions are violated, then I suppose we could avoid a lot of intermediate commits. The problem would become \"given that we know the results of some set of (automatic and manual) merges, what additional (automatic and manual) merges do we have to do to make more progress toward the end goal?\" The requirements would be:\r\n\r\n1. A manual merge should only be requested after its two direct ancestors are available.\r\n2. Automatic merges should always be done with the benefit of knowledge of any manual conflict resolutions that would be their ancestors. :point_left: This is the requirement that is impossible to fulfill in all backtracking cases without requiring the user to re-do merges that they have already done.\r\n\r\nLess ambitiously, it might make sense to omit some of the \"internal\" lines when outlining the merge frontier; e.g., instead of computing\r\n\r\n```\r\n*************\r\n*.....|.....|\r\n*.....|.....|\r\n*.....|.....|\r\n*.....|.....|\r\n*.....|-----+\r\n*.....|#?????\r\n*.....|??????\r\n*.....|??????\r\n*-----+??????\r\n```\r\n\r\none could save a few explicit merges by computing\r\n\r\n```\r\n*************\r\n*...........|\r\n*...........|\r\n*...........|\r\n*...........|\r\n*.....+-----+\r\n*.....|#?????\r\n*.....|??????\r\n*.....|??????\r\n*-----+??????\r\n```\r\n\r\n*On other fronts:* I did some heavy refactoring over the last couple of days to prepare the ground for the rebase-style strategy [described here](https://github.com/mhagger/git-imerge/issues/66#issuecomment-152476136); see branch `polymorphic-frontiers`. The new strategy isn't implemented yet but should be pretty easy now. As usual, the biggest hurdle is the lack of automated tests that could give confidence that the big refactoring hasn't broken anything. After the refactoring, it should be easier to play with other merge strategies, like those discussed above\u2014you basically just need to implement a new `MergeFrontier` class.\r\n"

Maybe restore to the SHA-1 that they were on (if it still exists)?)\r\n* The branch name would have to be recorded in `MergeRecord`.\r\n* It would have to be added to the `state` dict by `MergeRecord.save()` so that it can be remembered across invocations, and read back in by `MergeRecord.read()`. This change should probably be accompanied by an increment of `STATE_VERSION[2]`.\r\n* `git imerge abort` should only switch back to the starting branch if it still exists, if the working tree is clean, and perhaps only if the temporary branch is currently checked out. The code in `MergeState.remove()` might give you some ideas about this.

The help text is embedded in [`git-imerge`](https://github.com/mhagger/git-imerge/blob/master/git-imerge), for example [here](https://github.com/mhagger/git-imerge/blob/5951fad2945814930374cf0967d3f6b4c050b112/git-imerge#L48-L53), [here](https://github.com/mhagger/git-imerge/blob/5951fad2945814930374cf0967d3f6b4c050b112/git-imerge#L3768-L3771), and [here](https://github.com/mhagger/git-imerge/blob/5951fad2945814930374cf0967d3f6b4c050b112/git-imerge#L3783-L3786).\r\n\r\nIf you are ambitious, you might consider providing a little bit more explanation of these operations such as discussed [here](https://github.com/mhagger/git-imerge/issues/20#issuecomment-21297035) and [here](https://github.com/mhagger/git-imerge/issues/20#issuecomment-36331551).\r\n"

In cp1252 those bytes represent `\u00c3\u00bc`, the characters that you saw.\r\n`\u00c3\u00bc`, in turn, are `U+00C3 U+00BC` in Unicode. Those two characters are encoded in UTF-8 as `0xC3 0x83 0xC2 0xBC`, which are the bytes in the faulty commit.\r\n\r\nSo my guess is that Git is respecting the mingw64 configuration and outputting the commit metadata in UTF-8. But Python is reading the data under the assumption that it is cp1252, converting the `\u00fc` to two Unicode code points internally, and outputting them as four bytes of UTF-8. When you view the commit, Git assumes that the data are already in UTF-8 so it passes it through unchanged.\r\n\r\nI'm not an expert on encoding issues and know even less about encodings on Windows, but it seems to me that you want to tell Python to use UTF-8. One crude way to do this would be to set\r\n\r\n    PREFERRED_ENCODING = 'utf8'\r\n\r\nnear the top of the `git-imerge` script. Does that help?\r\n"

        "body": "Thanks for the suggestion.\r\n\r\nThe main point of the README is to explain `git-imerge` and teach people how to use it. I don't think the main body of the README is a good place for \"look, somebody mentioned `git-imerge`\" links. Since this shout-out is not very pedagogical, I don't think it belongs here in the text. I wouldn't want people who are trying to learn about how to use `git-imerge` to click on it, because it wouldn't have value to them.\r\n\r\nArguably the GitMinutes link falls in the same category. I haven't listened to it for a while, but I don't recall it being a very good resource for learning how to use `git-imerge`.\r\n\r\nBy contrast, @patrickmckenna's talk from Git Merge 2016 *would* be a good pedagogical link. But I can't find it online so maybe it wasn't recorded.\r\n\r\nInstead, maybe it would make sense to add a new \"Other `git-imerge` links\" section where we could collect significant mentions of `git-imerge` from around the web.\r\n\r\nBy the way, I think the way you have defined the link doesn't actually expose it to the reader unless there is a reference to it from the text.\r\n"

        "body": "I'm having trouble reading your diagram. Is this equivalent?\r\n\r\n```\r\nmaster:  0-1-2-3-4-6-7-- 8--9-10---11\r\n          \\           \\ /       \\ /\r\nmerge-1    \\           x         y\r\n            \\         /         /\r\nrelease-1:   a---b---c---------d\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf I understand correctly, you want to use `imerge` to do the merge at `y`, right?\r\n\r\nThe merge base for this merge is `c`. (See `git-merge-base(1)` for the definition of the merge base.) All of the changes that were introduced by `a` and `b` are already in `8` via the merge of `x` into `master`. So at `y` there should be no merge conflicts that involve the changes that were made in `a` and `b`.\r\n\r\nBut all of the changes made in `0..7` appear to the merge as if they were made in commit `x`, because that is the first commit that is a descendant of `c` that includes those changes.\r\n\r\nI think that if you had done a \"merge with history\" (i.e., retained the full incremental merge in your history), then you would have some additional context for the second imerge. Your history would look roughly like (I'm omitting some commits on master):\r\n\r\n```\r\nmaster:  0------1------2-------7---------------8--9-10---11\r\n          \\                     \\             /       \\ /\r\nmerge-1    \\                     a'          /         y\r\n            \\                     \\         /         /\r\n             \\                     b'      /         /\r\n              \\      other          \\     /         /\r\n               \\                     c'  /         /\r\n                \\       stuff         \\ /         /\r\n\t\t \\\t               x         /\r\n                  \\        in         /         /\r\n                   \\                 7'        /\r\n                    \\        here   /         /\r\n                     \\             2'        /\r\n                      \\           /         /\r\n                       \\         1'        /\r\n                        \\       /         /\r\nrelease-1:               a--b--c---------d\r\n```\r\n\r\nSo you would have to merge the changes from `d` with the commits `1'`, `2'`, `7'`, `x`, `8`, `9`, and `10`, which is more or less the minimum that you could hope for. But retaining all that extra parentage information would be quite cumbersome given the current state of tooling.\r\n\r\nI hope that helps!\r\n"

        "body": "@mhagger\r\n\r\nThanks for your response Michael. Let me give a concrete example here using a similar diagram you used to demonstrate how imerge works (tried to capture the screen as well in case the indent/space doesn't work). Let's say currently our master has commit 0, 1, 2. And community has v1.0 containing commit A, B. After a full merge the diagram is like:\r\n\r\n```\r\no - 0 -  1  - 2    \u2190 master\r\n    |    |    |\r\n    A - A1 - A2\r\n    |    |    |\r\n    B - B1 - B2\r\n    \u2191\r\n  v1.0\r\n```\r\n\r\nThen I have a branch merge-master-full persisting the above state. And I'll persist the rebase-with-history result to merge-master so merge-master is like:\r\n\r\n```\r\no - 0 - 1 - 2     \u2190 master\r\n    |       |\r\n    A - - -A2\r\n    |       |\r\n    B - - -B2\r\n    \u2191\r\n  v1.0\r\n```\r\n\r\nLater on there is commit C in community branch v2.0, and we want to do imerge again on merge-master-full instead of merge-master since I can apply C gradually on B1 and B2, instead of directly on B2 so the result is:\r\n\r\n```\r\no - 0 -  1  - 2    \u2190 master\r\n    |    |    |\r\n    A - A1 - A2\r\n    |    |    |\r\n    B - B1 - B2\r\n    |    |    |\r\n    C - C1 - C2\r\n    \u2191\r\n  v2.0\r\n```\r\n\r\nNow I want to do a simplification using \"rebase-with-history\" to get a new merge-master. However imerge only knows that C1-C2 is in progress so it won't collapse A1/B1 and the end result will be:\r\n\r\n```\r\no - 0 -  1  - 2    \u2190 master\r\n    |    |    |\r\n    A - A1 - A2\r\n    |    |    |\r\n    B - B1 - B2\r\n    |         |\r\n    C -  - - C2\r\n    \u2191\r\n  v2.0\r\n```\r\n\r\nAnd my desired result is:\r\n\r\n```\r\no - 0 - 1 -  2    \u2190 master\r\n    |        |\r\n    A - - - A2\r\n    |        |\r\n    B - - - B2\r\n    |        |\r\n    C - - - C2\r\n    \u2191\r\n  v2.0\r\n```\r\n\r\nSo my question is really how to get this last stage from the \"full\" merge result which is generated through 2 imerge merge operations.\r\n\r\nI'll copy this to the issue post on github so that you can answer from there.\r\n\r\n2018-05-30 12:28 GMT-07:00 Michael Haggerty <mhagger@alum.mit.edu>:\r\n> If all you want in the end is a simple merge, that's not hard to do by hand,\r\n> for example using `git imerge reparent` twice. I didn't quite understand why\r\n> you don't use `git imerge merge` in the first place, but I suppose you have\r\n> your reasons.\r\n>\r\n> If you want more detailed advice you should make a sketch or something to\r\n> make it more understandable. And preferably in an issue so that other people\r\n> can get involved.\r\n>\r\n> Hope that helps,\r\n> Michael\r\n>"

An alternative would be to use worktrees, though for a big repository they would be somewhat expensive to set up.\r\n\r\nI know that libgit2 can do merges without touching the working copy; that would be another alternative. See #109 for related info.\r\n\r\nIt will also be a little bit tricky to ask the user to intervene if there is a conflict.

        "body": "I was thinking a little bit more about your style of using `git-imerge`. It seems that you don't really *need* to preserve the full merge forever. What if you could instead simplify to a history that includes the incremental merges along *both* outer edges but omitting the merges in the interior? So for example, currently I believe that you retain both the full merge:\r\n\r\n```\r\no - 0 -  1  - 2    \u2190 master\r\n    |    |    |\r\n    A - A1 - A2\r\n    |    |    |\r\n    B - B1 - B2\r\n    \u2191\r\n  v1.0\r\n```\r\n\r\n(which has all of the information that you will need for subsequent merges) and the rebase-with-history:\r\n\r\n```\r\no - 0 - 1 - 2     \u2190 master\r\n    |       |\r\n    A - - -A2\r\n    |       |\r\n    B - - -B2\r\n    \u2191\r\n  v1.0\r\n```\r\n\r\n(which, if I understand correctly, is the version that you work off of day-to-day). What if, instead, you could simplify to this:\r\n\r\n```\r\no - 0 -  1  - 2    \u2190 master\r\n    |         |\r\n    A        A2\r\n    |         |\r\n    B - B1 - B2\r\n    \u2191\r\n  v1.0\r\n```\r\n\r\nLater on, if there are new commits `C` and `D` in community branch v2.0, you would again simplify the same way, giving you:\r\n\r\n```\r\no - 0 -  1  - 2    \u2190 master\r\n    |         |\r\n    A        A2\r\n    |         |\r\n    B - B1 - B2\r\n    |         |\r\n    C        C2\r\n    |         |\r\n    D - D1 - D2\r\n    \u2191\r\n  v2.0\r\n```\r\n\r\nWould that have all of the properties that you are looking for?\r\n\r\nIf you really need the rebase-with-history connections, you could alternatively simplify to\r\n\r\n```\r\no - 0 -  1  - 2    \u2190 master\r\n    |         |\r\n    A -  - - A2\r\n    |         |\r\n    B - B1 - B2\r\n    |         |\r\n    C -  - - C2\r\n    |         |\r\n    D - D1 - D2\r\n    \u2191\r\n  v2.0\r\n```\r\n\r\nor even\r\n\r\n```\r\no - 0 -  1  - 2    \u2190 master\r\n    |    |    |\r\n    A -  + - A2\r\n    |    |    |\r\n    B - B1 - B2\r\n    |    |    |\r\n    C -  + - C2\r\n    |    |    |\r\n    D - D1 - D2\r\n    \u2191\r\n  v2.0\r\n```\r\n\r\n, where you have a kind of \"rebase-with-history\" in both directions, but don't retain the internal commits (e.g., the parents of `D1` are `D` and `B1`).\r\n"

In particular, I'd like to be able to run more thorough tests at a corner, once it's been proven that merges in both directions give the same result. Or perhaps *only* run tests at the corners, not at every step along each edge. Or only test on horizontal increments (my local changes), not vertical ones (upstream changes). Or vice versa.\r\n\r\nOr maybe test merge conflict resolutions more. (that can/should also be done manually before the \"contiinue\")\r\n\r\nAll that is best done, I think, by passing an argument to the script. If it's actually a script name then it can be an explicit argument. If it's arbitrary shell commands then maybe it's better put into an environment variable.\r\n\r\nI suggest the following values: PROBE HINC VINC CORNER CONFLICT"

In once case I recall several dozen commits in a row (before a bad commit was reverted).\r\n\r\nSome of the bad commits made clang fail to compile. Some of them made it fail to build HelloWorld. Some of them made the resulting HelloWorld fail to work.\r\n\r\nThe worst was one commit that created a clang that infinite looped when trying to build HelloWorld. That was unexpected.\r\n\r\nSo, there should be a way to blacklist commits from both branches. The user should be able to given an initial blacklist obtained by other means, and git-imerge should update the blacklist if other bad commits are found.\r\n\r\nA text file with one commit hash per line is probably a good way to do this. The script of course should load this into a Python set.\r\n\r\nIf an HINC or VINC merge fails tests then the corresponding commit from the original branch should be tested and blacklisted if it fails. (or CORNER, if it runs more extensive tests than the HINC and VINC leading to it).\r\n"

Let me braindump a few bits of information that might be related:\r\n\r\n* While it is doing the incremental merge, `git-imerge` mostly uses `git merge` and `git commit` to create new commits. Are those commits getting signed as you would expect? (My guess is \"yes\".)\r\n\r\n* When the merge is done, `git-imerge finish` often creates new commit objects using `GitRepository.reparent`, which takes an existing commit (including its tree) and creates a new tree with different parents using `git hash-object`. I highly suspect that this step *doesn't* cause the resulting commit to be signed.\r\n\r\nIf that's all correct, then it seems to me that we need either a replacement for `git hash-object` in `GitRepository.reparent` that does signing correctly, or we need to sign the commit afterwards [using something like `git commit --amend --no-edit -n -S`](https://superuser.com/questions/397149/can-you-gpg-sign-old-commits).\r\n\r\nDo you have any insight here?\r\n"

        "body": "Thanks for the report.\r\n\r\nThe core of the problem is that `git-imerge` uses the \"porcelain\" command, `git log`, rather than the corresponding \"plumbing\" command, `git rev-list`. (That, in turn, is because `git rev-list` is broken when used with `--pretty`.) The output of `git log`, being \"porcelain\", is not guaranteed to be stable across Git versions.\r\n\r\nThat being said, I think we can fix this particular problem by always invoking `git log` with an additional option to disable signature display:\r\n\r\n    git -c log.showsignature=false log [...]\r\n\r\nNB: the new option has to come between `git` and `log`, not after `log`.\r\n\r\nDo you want to try to figure out where in `git-imerge` that option needs to be added and submit a pull request?\r\n"
