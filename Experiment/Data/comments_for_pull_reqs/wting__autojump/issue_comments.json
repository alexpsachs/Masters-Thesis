Autojump won't work if the prompt command is overwritten. Autojump on the other hand respects other tools in the prompt command and adds itself to the list without removing the other ones.\n\nLong story short: either reinstall autojump or submit a bug report to the git-prompt maintainer (or better, do both :))\n\nPS: please answer in the issue; i nearly missed your message.\n"

Hence adding it to the bash_profile with the installer would add it twice for all the other users...\n\nMaybe we should create an OS X-specific installer? If you think this is a good idea, can you fork the project, and add your fixed version of the installer? (install.macosx.sh ?)\n\nI'll then add it to my repo.\n"

Actually, when I first started autojump, it worked the way you describe; but I found out that the amount of work you perform in a directory is what counts, not the number of times you \"cd\" to it.\n\nIn any case, this would be pretty easy for you to change, but I'd suggest using the standard autojump for a week or two before making the change. You might change your mind :)\n"

You should wait a bit more for the database to fill itself, and then you'll be able to use autojump to move back and forth between your most used directories, using autocompletion if you want. For now since you have only one directory in the database, it's not very useful yet :)\n\nLet me know if you need more help!\n\njoel\n"

There already is a feature that deletes keys if the database becomes really too big.\n\nI think I'll merge the \"remove\" option, because this is really something autojump has been missing for a while.\n\nAnyways, thanks for your patches, it's great to have other people poking at the code from time to time.\n"

I find autojump already dangerous enough (you get used to a sequence making you jump somewhere, and if it changes somehow, you can end up doing stuff in the wrong place). Isn't approximate matching going to increase this?\n\nAlso, I don't really understand the need. I usually use autojump with two or three letter patterns, so I rarely have typos. Is it a real problem for you? How do you use autojump?\n\nIn any case, I find the performance improvements and the profiling very interesting. I'll try to inspect them and merge them ASAP.\n"

Suppose that I expect a jump to happen, but I make a typo and remain in the same directory. If I don't notice this, I could make my next commands in the wrong directory anyway. However, I agree that we should minimize the possibility of command mis-execution. Here's a suggestion: How about notifying the user when autojump uses approximate matching?

So it won't work properly if you do that.\n\nAbout the problem itself: are you sure the \"update_terminal_cwd\" isn't the cause of the problem? What happens if you remove it?\n\nNot having a mac at hand to test makes it hard to diagnose the problem, but if you can narrow it down a bit, I'm sure we can solve this :)\n"

Following the XDG Specification and only it, without a custom fallback, would make the scripts simpler and easier to understand and to maintain. Instead of [if $XDG_DATA_HOME exists then \u2026, but if it does not exist, then if .local/share exists then \u2026, else use ~], it would become [we follow the XDG Spec, that is: we use $XDG_DATA_HOME/autojump where $XDG_DATA_HOME default to .local/share] which is more understandable. I think maintaining the alternative of using ~ directly only adds confusion.\n\nIn addition, it would become easier for the Python scripts too (both autojump and jumpapplet): instead of relying on an environment variable $AUTOJUMP_HOME or trying to guess, they could just follow the spec, fullstop.\n"

However, it would be nice to have a better solution.\n\nHere is the relevant section of /etc/bashrc:\n\n```\n# Tell the terminal about the working directory at each prompt.\nif [ \"$TERM_PROGRAM\" == \"Apple_Terminal\" ] && [ -z \"$INSIDE_EMACS\" ]; then\n    update_terminal_cwd() {\n        # Identify the directory using a \"file:\" scheme URL,\n        # including the host name to disambiguate local vs.\n        # remote connections. Percent-escape spaces.\n       local SEARCH=' '\n       local REPLACE='%20'\n       local PWD_URL=\"file://$HOSTNAME${PWD//$SEARCH/$REPLACE}\"\n       printf '\\e]7;%s\\a' \"$PWD_URL\"\n    }\n    PROMPT_COMMAND=\"update_terminal_cwd; $PROMPT_COMMAND\"\nfi\n```\n\nCommenting this whole block makes autojump work.

That would mean that I would (almost) blindly merge your commits on the install scripts. In counterpart, you would try to support the scripts and fix related issues.\n\nOf course there is really no pressure to accept, but since you seem interested in autojump and since I have less and less time to devote to it, I think it could be beneficial for everybody. Any thoughts?\n"

In any case, an easy workaround is to scratch everything in your ~/.local/share/autojump directory (or alternatively remove .autojump\\* in your home directory if you don't have a .local/share directory). I think it should work.\n\nBefore you scratch them, could you please send me the incriminated files for inspection?\n"

I don't think we want to keep the temporary files.\n- Could you add a comment before the line that checks for nt, and explain why you check for it?\n- I'm unsure about the completion patch. Are you _certain_ that it handle files with spaces correctly?\n- Let's get rid of sudo altogether in the install scripts. The user that needs it can simply run \"sudo ./install.sh\".\n"

Any comments?\n- It would be nice to add this to make_release.sh, which is the script I use to create releases. Of course if you don't want to do it yourself, I can do it :)\n- Minor remark: you can use sed -i instead of copying and renaming the file.\n"

When I saw that this thread had been moved to 'Closed' without being answered I assumed it was not going to be answered, so I manually uninstalled version 18 and tried again with the Fedora package (which was version 15). I had exactly the same problem with this until I switched to using bash instead of zsh and on bash it appears to work normally. What I think might have been confusing it is the fact that although I was using zsh it was not a login shell I simply launched it with the -e switch (gnome-shell -e zsh) although that is purely speculation on my part. I have since uninstalled zsh as well. So basically I have worked around my own problem with this program. Thank you for replying anyway.\n"

I must say though , your implementation is pretty elegant, and it would be nice to have as an option.\n- About the second change, I'm thinking about removing -P by default. One problem that arises if you remove -P is that the same directory will be counted in different entries, so I'm not entirely sure about this. Any comments for other people?\n"

        "body": "Hi Joel,\n\nFirst of all, thanks for autojump. I love it.\n\n> If you find shift so expensive, why do you use capitals in your app's name (honnest question!)?\n\nI just tend to give proper capitalization to my folder names. I don't think that this is uncommon. For example, I'm on a Mac with the default filesystem (which is case insensitive but case preserving) and many system folders are capitalized by default. It also happens when I clone a git repo.\n\nNonetheless in terminal or in quicksilver i don't think about case. Also note how this is the case in this [comment on #53](https://github.com/joelthelion/autojump/pull/53#issuecomment-1900824) where lowercase strings are used to match capitalized titles.\n\n> I understand why you'd want this change, but unless there is overwhelming support for this, I'd rather leave it the way it is, because I think it makes sense to distinguish capitals from lowercase letters if the filesystem does.\n\nImo, even if the file system is case sensitive, there should be few to none cases where the user would want to distinguish a folder on autojump by case. I guess that people, usually, give different names to different folders and even if two folder are distinguished by name the ranking should sort things out (note however, that I never used a case sensitive file system). Also this is the standard behavior of Quicksilver.\n\n> Note that as a work around, you can use any part of the name of the directory as a dirspec, so j pp would probably work. \n\nThanks I wasn't aware of that.\n\n> You can also change the behavior of autojump by patching it, it should be pretty straight forward (and I can help you if you're stuck).\n\nI prefer to stick with the default version for being able update without need to re-patch every time. \n\nNow I'm a bit busy but if you changed your mind I can patch it in future. Otherwise please go ahead and close the issue.\n"

I was using command line switches as a temporary development fix, but it is awkward and I doubt we want people hacking the definition of the `j` alias in order to get their desired behavior.\n\nThis raises the broader issue of ranking matches given both scores and match quality. The approx matching thread might be the place for this discussion.

The approx matching thread might be the place for this discussion. I'm mulling over whether or not it would ever be desirable to rank an approximate match with high scores over an exact match with almost zero score. This might be another matter of taste that could be configurable?\n\nI think exact matching should always take priority over higher weighted approximate matching. I second the exact > case insensitive > flex > approx match priority approach.\n\nI looked at the Vimeo video, and it looks like Quicksilver treats exact and flex string match results the same prioritizing higher weights. While I think that works well for Launchy / Quicksilver where the primary task is opening programs, autojump's primary task is finding directory names where acronyms are not used as much.\n"

I presume you have your `_j` function in your `$FPATH`, otherwise you wouldn't even get the `j php__`. And ... we've quickly exhausted all I know about the ZSH autocomplete system.\n\nBest of luck figuring out what is going on.\n"

The overwhelming Mac community recommendation is to separately install and upgrade the system's version of Python.\n\nThe problem is there is a disconnect between OS X users that use the command line a lot (autojump's target demographic) but doesn't upgrade Python (i.e. non-Python devs). I'm hoping that `pip install argparse` is a viable compromise.\n\nIt's difficult to balance backwards compatibility and continue improving autojump. While Debian is on 2.5, and OS X on 2.6, Cygwin / Linux is on 2.7 for a while now. 2.7 is also a planned \"LTS\" release as well, so I feel that should be an acceptable bare minimum target Python.\n"

        "body": "To anyone still interested in fuzzy searching, I've implemented a basic fuzzy search in d7cea406. The previous implementations have experienced bit rot, and I've been refactoring the code over the weekend.\n\nTo clarify autojump's matching priority:\n1. Try exact match.\n2. Try case insensitive match.\n3. Try fuzzy match.\n\nFuzzy matching is a last case scenario, and there are certain limitations to the current fuzzy matching implementation:\n- It is case insensitive.\n- It only matches against the end directory of any path:\n  \n  `bar` given path `/usr/bin/lib/foo/bar`\n- It returns the highest weighted entry that matches at least 60% using Python's [difflib.get_close_match()](http://docs.python.org/library/difflib.html#difflib.get_close_matches).\n  \n  It uses [SequenceMatcher](http://docs.python.org/library/difflib.html) to return a list of good enough matches. I've tested it with simple transposing / missing characters and it works well enough.\n- It does _not_ handle multiple directory matching: e.g. `j foo bar` will only use `bar` to match with.\n- It does _not_ handle acronyms or give extra priority to first character of letters: e.g. `j MIT` will not match against `~/Massachusetts Institution of Technology`\n  \n  Quicksilver-style works well when you have instant feedback as you're typing, in addition many program names are multiple words. On the other hand, autojump feedback is comparatively slow. Also, I don't think multiple word directories are prevalent except on Windows.\n\nSo basically if you accidentally misspell a long directory name (e.g. `j thisreallylongnam`), the current implementation has a good chance of finding the correct directory. However if you're using 2-3 character jumps (e.g. `j lib`) it probably won't work as you would expect since there's a high chance of getting an exact / case insensitive match.\n"

That's why your example didn't work.\n\n``` console\n~$ export AUTOJUMP_KEEP_SYMLINKS=1\n~$ mkdir testdir\n~$ ln -s testdir testdir-sym\n~$ j testdir-sym\nautojump: directory 'testdir-sym' not found\nTry `autojump --help` for more information.\n~$ j testdir\n/Users/erik.allik/testdir\n```\n\nThat last line `j testdir` should not work _unless_ you've already created the directory before and it was pre-existing in the database.\n\nAlso, what @statik213 said was correct. Let's say your database looks like this:\n\n```\n100        /testdir\n```\n\nYou create a new symlink and add it to the database:\n\n```\n100        /testdir\n10         /testdir-sym\n```\n\nIf you type `j test`, autojump will still jump to the first entry because it's weighted higher. @statik213's point was that even if you add a symlink without resetting your database, if the names are overlapping you will still visit the full path, higher weighted database entry instead of the new symlink entry.\n\nIf you want to always prioritize symlinks over full paths, your best option is to zero out the current database and start over. Simply run `> ~/.local/share/autojump.txt`.\n"

Granted this is still a bug with symlinks, but not one that should be causing the problems in this thread. Both adding and searching the database does resolve to physical path.\n\n``` python\nclass Database:\n    def add(self, path, increment = 10):\n        \"\"\"\n        Increment existing paths or initialize new ones to 10.\n        \"\"\"\n        if path not in self.data:\n            self.data[path] = increment\n        else:\n            import math\n            self.data[path] = math.sqrt((self.data[path]**2)+(increment**2))\n        self.save()\n```\n\nIf you look up all instances of the variable `patterns`, you'll notice it's never modified to resolve to real path.\n\nIn either case, I've fixed this in the latest commit 3a7f211fb6.\n"

This is also when you can then use numbers, which basically only completes/selects one of the options.\n\nI don't know if there's an option to not use menucomplete, but list the possibilities right away (without having to press Tab a second time).\n"

The traceback from the second bug shows a problem with one of those functions (called `encode()` and `decode()`). Since Python  3 uses Unicode strings natively, I'm hoping that will solve the 2nd bug.\n\nWhat Tanguy Ortolo (Debian maintainer) did was apply a quick [patch](http://packages.debian.org/sid/autojump) to replace the first line of autojump with `#!/usr/bin/python` \u2192 `#!/usr/bin/python3` and change the respective package dependencies.\n"

I'm not sure that the result of a jump needs to be predictable, or rather, I'm not sure that the current behavior is intuitive in any way, because personally I would expect when searching (which is effectively what autojump is doing in some sense) I would get the most relevant result first, not necessarily the most popular (which is one factor, but not the only factor). Furthermore, predictability doesn't make a whole lot of sense as a metric of user friendliness because unless I'm going to go around jumpstating all the time, I don't know off the top of my head that I spent twice as much time in `foobar` as `foo`, for instance. All I know is that I want to get to `foo` and typing `j foo` doesn't get me there which is completely unintuitive. But if it's technically not possible to do this fast then it makes sense to not bother, I think. Some sort of flag might be a good compromise. I might poke into it in a little bit if I have time to see how things are done. Although jumpstat runs pretty fast so I'm not sure that speed is a problem here.\n"

        "body": "> 1. Autojump is loaded, and I j volumes gmm<TAB> (request autocompletion suggestions) for somewhere in the remote mount. Not a big deal, and understandable why it might be laggy.\n\nautojump is finding all matching directories, and then checking to make sure they exist. That last part is probably what is causing the lag for remote systems.\n\n> 1. Autojump is loaded, my pwd is somewhere in the remote mount, and bash needs to show me the prompt. Doesn't matter if I've just j'ed in, or cd'd to a subdirectory, or exited sbt -- it lags before showing prompt.\n\nThis bothers me quite a bit, as autojump should not be causing lag in this situation. From what I can tell, it's caused by something in `PROMPT_COMMAND` but not by `autojump_add_to_database()`. If you have the time, I would look in autojump.bash.\n\nIn the bash wrapper, `PROMPT_COMMAND` is essentially set to a beefed up version of `autojump_add_to_database`, so I'm curious as to why it causes lag in certain cases, but not when called explicitly.\n\nOops, sorry for the wrong label. I saw linguistics and naturally thought of NLP. Ironic since my wife has a masters in linguistics. I took Mooney's info retrieval class a while back, great professor.\n"

I also tried putting ~/.autojump/bin on the path. Nothing helped.\nAutojump itself works (e.g. \"j src\"), but tab-completion does not. It just shows the files of the current directory.\n\nAnyway, let me express my deep gratitude for all your development work! I very much would have liked to come up with a solution rather than just a complaint, but I were not able to fix this...\n"

I did not test with `~/.autojump` directory present, so this line was not even executed. Should be fixed now (famous last words).\n\nAs a side note, I think the usefulness of the `.sh` wrapper is questionable.\n1. It's sourced from a shell-specific rc file already, so you don't really need a generic wrapper to dispatch on the shell type.\n2. It checks for local installation first, but you can source either a global or a local one explicitly from the init file as directed by install instructions. Maybe if you want to share your rc file across machines, one local installation, another global, but not sure if it's mainstream enough case to be worth added complexity.\n\nThoughts?\n"

This issue seems to come up time and time again: #65.\n\nYes, I could, but the problem is I really doubt they would see and read \none message in the whole package installation output. I mean, if a user \ndoes not even think of reading autojump's manpage (which I patched to \nindicate it has to be sourced) or the package's README.Debian (standard \nmain information file for any Debian package), or to report such a bug \nto Debian rather than to autojump, I do not see how he could pay any \nattention to installation messages\u2026\n\nI could add a debconf screen for that, which is modal and cannot be \nmissed, but that would probably be an abuse of debconf which is made for \nconfiguring packages, not for displaying information. And it would have \nto be a low priority debconf screen not to block automated \ninstallations, so it would not be displayed on systems configured to \nignore low priority debconf screens, which is usually the case for those \npeople.\n\nNow, I think there is one thing that may be more useful: create and \ninstall a script named /usr/bin/j, that just indicates what has to be \ndone to load autojump for Bash or Zsh.\n\n## \n\n  ,--.\n: /`)   Tanguy Ortolo      <xmpp:tanguy@ortolo.eu>\n|`-'    Debian Developer   irc://irc.oftc.net/Tanguy\n  _\n"

        "body": "Resurrecting: I just encountered a stalled autojump as well (release 21.6.9). I found two strange sorts of entries in the `autojump.txt` database:\n\nFirst, several entries for a directory with an unusual character in the name (a German \u00fc Umlaut), but stored in composed form. The dirname occured several times, with each \u00fc duplicated from one line to the other. Yep, exponential growth - I found my file being roughly 1 GB in size.\n\nSecond, an entry with just the weight, but empty dir. Probably because I had to kill a chroot the hard way, and I can imagine autojump being interrupted while trying to write the line). autojump wasn't able to recover from that, failing to parse the line. Suggestion: if you find an imparsable line (in particular, an empty dir name), just delete it?\n\nWhen I removed the strange unicode entries, autojump immediately started to produce `tmp...` files in the database folder, each of ~16MB, and forked instances again. Restarting autojump helped, and then I was presented a parsing error for the second problem. Not sure if or how the two situations are related, but maybe at least the second one is easily fixable?\n\nThanks a lot for autojump, BTW!\n\nBest\n"

        "body": "It appears in $XDG_DATA_HOME/autojump.txt (or, if you haven't set that, in ~/.local/share/autojump) there's a number that isn't a valid floating point number.\n\nIf you're on a mac or windows, this file path will vary. On macs, it should be ~/library/autojump/autojump.txt, and Windows should be C:\\Users{user name}\\AppData\\autojump\\autojump.txt.\n\nAs for what caused this, I'm not sure. But you can fix this by opening the autojump.txt file in your data path and changing the line which has \"14.14210.0\" to \"14.14210\". Do the same for any lines which contain non-floating point numbers on the LHS of the tab. The format of the file should be:\n\n```\nfloating-point-num\\tfilepath\n```\n\nEx:\n\n```\n10.0\\t/home/user\n```\n\nAs a fix for this, there are a number of options. The program could ignore entries which are invalid, or attempt to have a more robust form of parsing that chops off extra decimals (and subsequent numbers). It's interesting that this happened in the first place, did you modify your autojump data file?\n"

        "body": "@halilim: Thanks for the call that invokes the crash.\n\nI'm pretty sure it's a race condition when saving the database. autojump is called anytime `cd` is invoked, and in the past this was a blocking action. On slower, spinning hdds or network drives people were annoyed by this lag every time they changed directory so I made it async.\n\nHowever saving the database is a two step action to prevent data loss (save to temp file, then overwrite database with temp file). What's happening when you spam a bunch of `cd` commands at once is the multiple instances of autojump are clobbering each other.\n\nA quick fix is probably to use a `tempfile.TemporaryFile()` and copy over the existing database. This means that some directory changes may be lost during race conditions, but it's acceptable and certainly better than crashing and showing a stack trace.\n\nAnother fix is to use a semaphore with a lock file, and basically block writes until that process holds the lock. I think this process is overkill since most of the dropped writes with the above suggested implementation are from `cd` spamming. Also if autojump ever crashes in a middle of a write it could leave the system in an inconsistent state requiring user intervention to fix.\n"

That way your changes don't induce the creation of pacnew/pacsave files (and/or blow your changes away) on the next pacman update.\n\nFor now, I'm going to keep the symlink into my completion.d directory, but I think your solution is very good.\n"

If one of these characters appears, then the word is regarded as a pattern, and replaced with  an alphabetically sorted list of file names matching the pattern.\n\nSo \"alphabetically sorted\" should apply here.

In /etc/profile.d/autojump.sh \n\n```\n# source autojump on BASH or ZSH depending on the shell\n\nshell=`echo ${SHELL} | awk -F/ '{ print $NF }'`\n```\n\nSo plainly, the assumption is that SHELL is set to the current shell. However, SHELL is actually set by reading /etc/passwd, so it indicates the user's default shell, not the shell that happens to be in use at any given time.\n\nFrom [this discussion on stackoverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/a/3327022/698835) I suggest determining whether ZSH or BASH are in use by checking whether the environment variables ZSH_NAME or BASH are set.\n"

I tested v21.7.1 with Ubuntu 12.04 (13 levels deep, spinning hdd) and OSX (11 levels deep, ssd).\n\nEvery time you change directory, autojump loads the db from disk into memory, updates an entry, and writes it back to disk as a blocking action. If there was slowness I would attribute it to a large database or slow disk and it would affect all entries. I'm kind of surprised by the 8 directory deep cutoff, as that doesn't make any sense.\n\nCan you post the results of these commands please?\n\n``` shell\n$ time autojump --add /1/2/3/4/5\n$ time autojump --add /1/2/3/4/5/6/7/8/9/0\n```\n\nFor what it's worth, adding paths is non-blocking in v22.0-alpha.\n"

I dug into the `\\`brew --prefix`/etc/`to find that instead of a generic executable (`autojump`), there are now executables for each type of shell (`autojump.sh`,`autojump.zsh`,`autojump.fish`,`autojump.bash`). Once I updated the setup line in my .zshrc file (as others have mentioned above), it worked great:\n\n``` bash\n[[ -s `brew --prefix`/etc/autojump.zsh ]] && . `brew --prefix`/etc/autojump.zsh\n```\n\nThe trick was to use the **zsh** one since I am using zsh as my default shell.

        "body": "Okay. Cracked the issue, guys. Apparently, there was a directory whose name had some special characters in it, including \"newline\" character. And so, when I checked in the `~/.local/share/autojump/autojump.txt` file, I found that it was in this fashion: (the second directory is the culprit)\n\n```\n10 some/normal/directory\n10 the/malicious/directory-!\nname\n10 another/normal/directory\n```\n\nSo, its name was overflowing to the next line. \n\nNow, I had intentionally created this directory to test some of my script (I like to test my scripts for all sorts of weird scenarios including file names containing alien characters). I don't think any user would ever have a directory or file name with newline as a character and so this issue would never occur.\n\nBut if there is some way to resolve this, do look at it. \n\nSo let me now re-frame the issue: \n\n_**Autojump will stop working if a file/directory name containing newline character gets added to its database.**_\n"

There's a race condition (exacerbated by shell scripts / commands that traverse directories like `find`) where the lock fails and the db gets overwritten.\n\nThe proper way to fix is either:\n1. Fix the file locking to be race condition safe.\n2. Switch from a database like format to an append only log (like `.bash_history`, `.zsh_history`, etc), and only calculate the weights when someone invokes autojump to switch directories (aka `j`).\n"

But this is all I got was the directory displayed not cd'd into.\n\nBut I think the issue in my case and for people's future reference is a long time ago we needed to have an alias for autojump, so in my alias.zsh file I had a line\n\nalias j=\"autojump\"\n\nWhich when I just removed it, autojump started to work. And with just \"j\" and no alias needed.\n\nThanks\n\nMark\n"

Autojump by default installs a hook into your prompt that allows it to automatically update a database of paths and weights based on what directories you spend time running commands in.

I'm only testing this on SSDs, so the variance on a spinning hdds is probably higher.\n\n> seems like you could:\n> 1. set an env var on the first brew --prefix\n\nEnvironment variables aren't persistent between shells.\n\n> 1. let me set the env var myself and skip the brew --prefix entirely\n\nThis requires manual syncing of the env var and brew installs, and isn't user friendly.\n\n> 1. skip the command -v brew &>/dev/null since presumably it's redundant with brew --prefix\n\nThis is definitely doable.\n\nAt the end of the day loading `autojump.zsh` invokes spawning subshells and disk seeks costing 30 - 370 ms, some of which may or may not be attributed to `brew --prefix`.\n\nI would love to make autojump faster, is there any better evidence that localizes the issue to `brew`?\n"

One is when the first entry is incorrect and the user wants to jump again:\n\n``` bash\n[~] $ j foo\n[~/foobar] $ j foo # I'm in the wrong foo directory\n[~/project/foobar] $\n```\n\nThe other is the one you describe, muscle memory:\n\n``` bash\n[~] $ j foo\n[~/foobar] $ j foo # muscle memory\n[~/project/foobar] $ # ugh, I want to go back\n```\n\nOne quick workaround is to simply use `cd -` to jump to the previously used directory (or `-` in zsh), which I use often.\n\nLet's say we remove jumping to next best directory.\n\n``` bash\n[~] $ j foo\n[~/foobar] $ j foo\n[~/foobar] $ # Nothing happened, why?\n```\n\n^^ I think that will be confusing to people because they're running a command and nothing is happening, but it seems random and doesn't explain why. I'm not sure that would be a experience for most users.\n"

Making the move atomic will help, but I think what you really want is to make autojump_data.save() atomic.  Right?  Just fixing move() doesn't completely work, right?  I could be wrong, I just glanced at that function for a second.\r\n\r\nDo you know what I'm getting at?

I was not thinking about race condition, in which case it would only miss new directory entries (this indeed happens sometimes to me though, maybe there's also race condition but that's not the main problem), not truncating database file.\r\n\r\nIIRC when I was debugging the `load` function occasionally gets empty result, and that's when the file truncating happens. So my guess was maybe at some time the database file is actually empty (possibly during the move since the only part it touches that db file is `move_file`). So yes, I think atomic is the real problem here, but those are just my thought.\r\n\r\nI haven't experienced this issue since then. Looking forward to your feedback :)"

I  reused code I found elsewhere like this:\r\n\r\n    xdg_data_home = os.path.join(os.path.expanduser('~'), '.local', 'share')\r\n    xdg_aj_home = os.path.join(xdg_data_home, 'autojump')\r\n    temp = NamedTemporaryFile(delete=False, dir=xdg_aj_home)\r\n\r\nThe first thing I don't understand is why there is a difference between new directory entries and truncated db?  Sounds like you found out that autojump sometimes deletes the whole db.  Please share.  Why does autojump ever do that?\r\n\r\nMy other confusion is why you don't consider this a race condition.  The atomic-ness of `mv` is irrelevant for any single thread since `mv` blocks in all cases.  Even if `mv` is interrupted, no single thread could simultaneously call `mv` and read the db.  `mv` could fail, but then autojump would have to ignoring the error and then read.  And, even then, I'm confident `mv` isn't failing with the mv half completed...hmm, okay, I guess I'm not confident, but then why would `mv` only be failing for autojump and not other callers?"

The problems is that sometimes the `load` gets empty (or nearly empty) result, maybe its because at the load time the original file is indeed empty (caused by non-atomic `move`).  Answer in this SO [question](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/20873723/is-pythons-shutil-copyfile-atomic) explains how `copyfile` works, which is used by `shutil.move` when not in the same filesystem.\r\n\r\nBut that's just my hypothesis, I'm not so sure and that's why I don't submit a PR, maybe the real problem is somewhere else, or maybe there's a better way. My modification seems more like a workaround. After all, putting tmp files in /tmp is very reasonable. I prefer leaving this to the author."

        "body": "@wting: You mentioned that one way to resolve the problem might be to switch to an \"append only log\" and calculate weights when autojump is run.\r\n\r\nI suppose you are avoiding this solution because the log might become prohibitively long over time. (And, also, because it would be nice if the existing system worked in the way we think it should.)\r\n\r\nBut perhaps a hybrid solution is possible? Append entries to a log, but add an autojump command that converts them to the database format. When autojump is run, consult both the log and the database to calculate the actual weights.\r\n\r\nThe foremost downside to this is that it requires the user to collapse the database manually. A work around would be to do a random test each time autojump is run to determine if the db should be collapsed. This would, at least, decrease the odds of a race condition."

Is it possible cd is not being overridden? If that's the case where should it happen?\r\n\r\nI'll also say that neither that autjump directory nor the autjump.txt file existed until I manually created them, and it's still not getting populated.\r\n\r\nI've got GitBash running on this machine, but I've also tried with clink-ified cmd to no avail.\r\n\r\nYears ago I had autojump running fine in cygwin on Win7, but I don't remember having to really jump through many hoops.\r\n\r\nLike I said, happy to devote time to a fix, but I'm pretty busy with work and my commute right now is 3hrs+ each way right now, so I likely won't have time till a weekend."

It really means a lot to me that people find autojump useful and are willing to donate.\r\n\r\nI've been using various open source projects for the past 2 decades and have built my career on other's contributions over the years. autojump is just a small way I can give back to the community.\r\n\r\nI'll do one better. I will match any donation to [ACLU](https://www.aclu.org/how-you-can-help#donate) or [EFF](https://supporters.eff.org/donate) up to $50 per person. Simply make a donation and then forward the confirmation email to io(at)williamting.com, and I'll make a matching donation.\r\n\r\nCheers! :beers: "

That's because I broke my python autojump by mixing it with this [Rust `autojump`](https://crates.io/crates/autojump), and fixed it by hand (i.e. hacked my bashrc).\r\n\r\nI guess it warrants a full retest, but it would take me a while to get to it (need to break my computer again, and I don't want to do that *juust* yet)"
