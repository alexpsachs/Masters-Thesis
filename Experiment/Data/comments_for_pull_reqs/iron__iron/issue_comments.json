This makes it impossible to extend with bound lifetimes (with or without unsafe) as the type checker will always fail to coerce these lifetimes.\n\n```\nerror: mismatched types: expected `&mut http::server::response::ResponseWriter<'b>` but found `&mut http::server::response::ResponseWriter<'_>`\n```\n- Transmute the `ResponseWriter` unsafely to have the same lifetimes as `IronResponse` (through the trait implementation).\n  \n  Again, the function is given a `ResponseWriter` with anonymous lifetimes. Instead of the lifetime being incompatible with what the compiler expects, the compiler expects _nothing_.\n  \n  The `ResponseWriter` is given a lifetime that will last the duration of the response (as it should), until it goes out of scope at the end of the inner `serve_forever` loop (see **rust-http**'s source for details). The `IronResponse` (or other concrete type implemented on the `Response` trait) is given a lifetime that will last from the beginning of our transmute through the end of our middleware-traversing function (`handler` in the iron mod). This means that the type being transmuted _to_ has a shorter lifetime than that being transmuted _from_, so we should encounter no issues from our unsafe block.\n\nDespite its unseemliness, the compiler seems right - this should not compile - even though we know that it will be fine if it does. I think we can justify our use of `unsafe` here.\n\n@reem, @theptrk @mcreinhard: Motion to close this issue.\n"

I think I might take a crack at it later today and see if I can make the entire scheme more convenient.\n"

I think that's how some of the simpler middleware frameworks do it: they map errors directly to HTTP error responses. But then again, that might break if the error occurs after the response has already been partially written\u2014I don't know all the cases that have to be handled in modern HTTP.\n\nGood luck, and thank you for a great library!\n"

I don't want to take away that functionality, as it allows multiple controllers to contribute to serving.

        "body": "I think it's cleaner to just provide a `Templating` trait that any template engine could implement, then you provide an instance of that trait to the templating middleware and it uses that for `res.render`. My main concern is that `res.render` would have no access to the `Alloy` and therefore no access to any configuration.\n\nThis is solvable by placing a second `Alloy` in Response, but I'm not sure if that's the way to go. I think there is a better, more general way to do app-wide configuration than this, but I'm not sure how yet.\n\nMaybe the best way would be to add a global-configuration Alloy on each _Iron_ instance - then provide a &-reference to the app in both request and response? This is fast but also quite convenient, and could in fact be made memory efficient by storing the global Alloy behind an Arc, so it is not cloned for each request.\n"

Feel free to file issues on rust-url, what you find annoying is likely to be annoying to other users too. Now, about this specific issue, would something like this help?\n\n``` rust\nimpl Url {\n    /// This takes ownership of / moves the URL.\n    pub fn to_relative_scheme_url(self) -> Result<RelativeSchemeUrl, Url> {\n        match self.scheme_data {\n            RelativeSchemeData(RelativeSchemeData { username, password, host, port, path }) => {\n                Ok(RelativeSchemeUrl {\n                    scheme: self.scheme,\n                    username: username,\n                    password: password,\n                    host: host,\n                    port: port,\n                    path: path,\n                    query: self.query,\n                    fragment: self.fragment,\n                })\n            },\n            _ => Err(self)\n        }\n    }\n}\n\n\npub struct RelativeSchemeUrl {\n    pub scheme: String,\n    pub username: String,\n    pub password: Option<String>,\n    pub host: Host,\n    pub port: String,\n    pub path: Vec<String>,\n    pub query: Option<String>,\n    pub fragment: Option<String>,\n}\n```\n\nThis is basically the fields of `Url` (except `scheme_data`) and `RelativeSchemeData` together in a flat struct.\n\nAs to the port number, [it should be a `u16` integer](https://www.w3.org/Bugs/Public/show_bug.cgi?id=26446) rather than a string.

        "body": "Hmmm, I do like that a generic URL has fields common to both, although the complete enum design has its benefits.\n\nI suspect that most times when parsing a URL you expect one type or the other. Certainly for our purposes, code like this would be good:\n\n``` rust\nlet url: RelativeSchemeUrl = match Url::parse(url_string) {\n    Ok(generic_url) => {\n        match generic_url {\n            RelativeSchemeUrl(url) => url,\n            _ => return Error(\"Not a relative scheme url.\");\n        }\n    },\n    Err(e) => return Error(e)\n}\n```\n\nThe same pattern would apply when parsing `data:` URLs. You could maintain access to `scheme`, `query` and `fragment` using methods.\n\nThis change, being quite fundamental, may also depend on how you parse `data:` URLs, which I noticed is a TODO in the readme. I'm guessing you plan to parse the MIME type, character set and content encoding?\n\nThis may necessitate splitting `NonRelativeSchemeUrl` further, perhaps using an enum? Or maybe just a struct with optional fields?\n\n``` rust\nstruct NonRelativeSchemeUrl {\n    scheme: String,\n    mime_type: Option<MediaType>,\n    charset: Option<String>,\n    encoding: Option<Encoding>,\n    body: String\n}\n```\n\nOh god, I just looked up the list of schemes...\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/URI_scheme#Official_IANA-registered_schemes\n"

The only compromise is the port, which we could make non-optional for HTTP(S) URLs. Given this, and Simon's previous comment about libraries extending `rust-url`, we could leave `rust-url` intact and just write our own wrapper (or do both?).\n\n``` rust\npub struct WebUrl {\n    pub scheme: String,\n    pub username: String,\n    pub password: Option<String>,\n    pub host: Host,\n    pub port: u16,\n    pub path: Vec<String>,\n    pub query: Option<String>,\n    pub fragment: Option<String>,\n}\n```\n"

I thought there may have been a funky static guarantee I was missing.\n\nA consistent API seems like a good idea, and name clashes resolvable as type parameters are easy to read, e.g. `req.get::<m1::Type>()`.\n\nWould it be too much to ask for versions with and without option types? There are certainly cases where we could guarantee the creation of the Plugin, and hence it's presence in the map. This complicates the get method though, I don't think you can overload for types fulfilling different traits?\n"

It also makes them usable outside of a Chain. For instance, we could do something like:\n\n``` rust\nIron::new(Logger::new().from_handler(whatever))\n```\n\nDirectly, to avoid issues with \"you must link first and last\" etc.\n"

        "body": "As with the removal of `Response::serve` this change is in line with the new method of working with Responses, i.e. that Response is created in a Handler just once, and future AfterMiddleware have rights to modify, but usually should not replace, an existing Response.\n\nDefaultErrors should probably either re-implement the logic in `from_file`, which is ugly I know (but at least it's just 3 or 4 lines), or get the body out of a fake Response generated with `from_file`. I regret that it is unergonomic, but I think it is ok for it to be this way as most AfterMiddleware should not be replacing the Response wholesale, just doing postprocressing.\n\nDefaultErrors seems like an exception to the rule, so is unfortunately not as easy to create. There might be merit to a less opinionated method, but it seems that it is simple enough to implement in any crate which absolutely needs it and might not be something we want to encourage.\n"

        "body": "Just to be clear, there is no _existing response_ when using `Response::from_file`, it's a static method.\n\nI've been having a read of your default errors middleware and I think it would be well suited to being `AroundMiddleware` in the new system. Because handlers return `Result` types, you could make the behaviour dependant on the errors returned rather than the status codes. This would then require a way to map error types onto status codes, which you could do with a modified `TypeMap`, or a trait. Here's some code (using a trait) to demonstrate what I mean:\n\n``` rust\n// defaulterror/lib.rs\nuse iron::status::{mod, Status};\n\n// Implement this trait on expected error types.\ntrait DefaultError {\n    fn default_error() -> Status {\n        status::NotFound\n    }\n}\n\nstruct DefaultErrorHandler {\n    wrapped_handler: Box<Handler + Send + Sync>,\n    status_map: HashMap<Status, SomeObject>\n}\n\nimpl Handler for DefaultErrorHandler {\n    fn call(&self, req: &mut Request) -> IronResult<Response> {\n        match self.wrapped_handler() {\n            Ok(res) => Ok(res),\n            Err(e) => {\n                let error_handler = self.status_map.find(e.default_error());\n                // Use the error handler to create the response (with a function, from a file, whatever)\n                Ok(error_handler.create_response())\n            }\n        }\n    }\n}\n\nimpl AroundMiddleware for DefaultErrorHandler {\n    fn with_handler(&mut self, handler: Box<Handler + Send + Sync>) {\n        // XXX: Impossible to create self.handler with an empty value,\n        // so this doesn't really work... Option<Box<Handler + Send + Sync>> may be necessary.\n        self.handler = handler\n    }\n}\n```\n\nThen, when using the default errors library, you specify custom mappings by implementing the trait.\n\n``` rust\nimpl DefaultError for NoFile {\n    fn default_error() -> Status { status::NoContent }\n}\nimpl DefaultError for NoMatch {}\n```\n\nHmmm, it could even be useful to map straight from error types to response producers, so you can have multiple pages with the same status code (a 404 for a missing file might look different to a 404 for a missing route).\n\nI think we've also run into a broader deficiency in the `AroundMiddleware` system, namely that capturing the `handler` will require an `Option` type. Have we actually implemented anything as `AroundMiddleware` yet? I'll open a separate issue.\n"

IMO the nicest way to do this would be to implement a method on `Option<H: Handler>` which returns an `IronResult<Response>`, with `None` mapping to `Err(UnitializedHandler)`.\n"

I feel like we're going backwards in terms of creating an intuitive server for our developers.\n\nPersonally, I much prefer to the existing Nop implementation. That way, developers building on top of Iron have less boilerplate, the library is more intuitive, and we avoid all the Option complexity as well.

This depends on whether you are creating a test for BeforeMiddleware, AroundMiddleware, Handlers, or AfterMiddleware.\n\nIn lieu of better docs (I'm working on it, promise :)) the general strategy I would take for each is:\n\nFor all: use https://github.com/reem/iron-test to mock Request and Response.\n\nBefore: Create a Request, pass in an &mut reference to it, check if it has the state you want afterwards.\n\nHandlers: Create a Request, pass in an &mut reference to it, check if the Response looks the way you want.\n\nAfter: Create a Request and Response, pass in &mut references to both of them, check if they have the state you want afterwards.\n\nAround: Create a mock Handler, create a Request, initialize the AroundMiddleware, then do the same thing as for testing handlers.\n\nI'll keep this issue open as there should really be better docs/examples surrounding this. (middleware in the iron org should also be tested much more than they are now).\n"

        "body": "Hi, I have talked with @reem in IRC but also want to update here. I have been working on a [handlebars template engine for rust](https://github.com/sunng87/handlebars-rust) and I'm going to create an [iron middleware](https://github.com/sunng87/handlebars-iron) for integration.\n\nBy far, the handlebars-rust project is almost finished and should support most of handlebars features, helper customization and template inheritance. I'm now working on the middleware. Since it's still difficult to compile iron against rust nightly, I may still need several days for it.\n\nAs discussed with @reem, we will create a new `Template` struct contains template name and data you want to render. `Template` will implement `Modifier` for `Response`, so users can call `response.set(template)`. The information will be stored in extensions and processed by middleware. I'm also going to keep it easy to test. So users can test their handlers by retrieving data from extensions (in test function).\n"

        "body": "To answer some questions above, handlebars is a widely used template syntax created by Yokuda Hatz (yes, it's who made cargo also) originally in javascript. In handlebars-rust, there is a tricky point that you have to make the data implements `ToJson` so we can render it. Because in handlebars, there's if/else, each and some other custom flow controls, data are not only for rendering, but also to control rendering. So I can't just use a \"Show\" trait or String/&str type for it. Lucky enough, most common data structure implements `ToJson`, so we can use it without (too much) pain.\n"

I've thought about it and the issues that come up with direct `Response` streaming aren't really an issue for `Request`, since there is only one state (i.e. no \"status line written\", \"headers written\", \"nothing written\" etc.). \n\nThe major issue I anticipate is that this makes testing a bit trickier, but from my memory of the internals of Hyper I think it's actually pretty easy to mock an `HttpWriter` with whatever data you want. This also has the side-effect of making `Request` no longer `'static` or `Send` (since `HttpWriter` is given to us by Hyper with a lifetime), which can be a pain.\n"

That would break anyways with this change, since the ordering of the middleware affects how much of the body might have been read.\n\nPerhaps `BeforeMiddleware` can get a `RequestInfo` struct that provides everything but the body, or separate the body from `Request` and pass it to `Handler` directly.\n"

It should be rare for the Handler to be responsible for dealing with a raw request body directly.\n\nBeforeMiddleware used to fill this role, but the lazily-evaluated and cached nature of Plugins actually makes them ideal for dealing with this sort of one-shot data.\n\nA badly written BeforeMiddleware can already cause all sorts of havoc by setting properties on Request to nonsensical values - providing the body as a reader doesn't change that.\n"

Current flow is still complicated, because:\n1. We need to think about indexes of middlewares with `catch` methods.\n2. Catch signature is the same in all the middleware types, and I don't know which type I need to select to handle some common error which can happen everywhere.\n\nI propose to remove `catch` method from the middlewares and introduce new middleware type: `CatchMiddleware` (maybe `middleware` is the bad name for that thing, maybe just `Catcher` is better) with one `catch` method. When error fires we just pass it through _all the catchers_. It's much simpler for me to understand this flow with `Catchers`: Need to handle some specific error? Just place the Catcher to the catcher list.\n\nWhat do you think? Do you see some disadvantages of that flow?\n"

There are also a bunch of polish issues with Iron and associated middleware, though I am rapidly addressing them and making it a core focus for the next few weeks.\n\nPerformance is definitely a goal of Iron, but it has to be framed inside the blocking-IO world that it lives in, which means it won't be as fast as some other fast solutions built on asynchronous IO. That said, Iron wrecks node.js and other higher-level evented libraries in req/sec (by like an order of magnitude). \n\nI don't know enough about vibe.d (I had to google it) to really compare it to Iron, but from what I've read it appears to be based on non-blocking IO, which means it will have a different performance model than what Iron has.\n"

        "body": "@SkylerLipthay The simplest thing is to just add another dependency on `lazy_static` and load it there.\n\nThis whole methods feels a bit not so good. It should really parse directly from the extension string to an instantiated `Mime`, which is cloned. This avoids allocating an intermediate string and the cost of re-parsing. Setting the raw header is a bit bad practice and more importantly will just move the cost of re-parsing later if it is ever accessed again.\n\nThe way we used to do it was with [rust-http-content-type](https://github.com/reem/rust-http-content-type), which generated a phf table of extension => rust-http mime instance. In this case it would be extension => hyper mime instance. Unfortunately depending on a modified version of that would ruin all hope of us being usable in 1.0 stable.\n\nAll of that said, it seems the best way forward is to do the simplest thing and use `lazy_static` to store a `Types` instance.\n"

This is part of the WHATWG URL spec: https://url.spec.whatwg.org/#query-state\n\nOnce the URL parsing state machine enters the fragment state it treats all subsequent characters as part of the the fragment, and there's no way to get back to the query state to parse the `&q1=v1` part.\n\n@waqqas-abdulkareem, could you provide a link to the Facebook API you're dealing with? From my investigations so far it seems they may be returning invalid URLs, or there's some error elsewhere in the pipeline.\n"

        "body": "I'm in favour of making it optional by default, the reason I didn't was simply to keep existing projects from breaking on the next update if they used HTTPS. In fact, I'm not really sure why Hyper didn't do so, since that update was a breaking change anyway.\n\nThe issue is that it comes down to iron having two different types of dependencies. Middleware and plugins only depend on iron to extend its functionality and need access to core types and traits. End users of the framework also want the server spawning functionality. It may make sense to split them up into two separate crates, where middleware depends on `iron_core` and then `iron` just re-exports it all for users of the framework. For now though, making HTTPS truly optional isn't bad.\n\nAlso nice inline syntax, I wasn't aware of that! FWIW, in general, a `features = [\"!ssl\"]` would be pretty useful, though it feels like a cheating short-circuit solution.\n"

I thought that the structs went always instantiated and binded for the `ref.method() syntax`.\n\nNow I see that an AroundMiddleware was not necessary. Apart from this example I am interested in the use case of a rest webservice that uses json and wants to \"describe\" errors for not met requirements. In that case, with an AfterMiddleweare I cannot change the response content, only the response headers. True?\n"

        "body": "IMO, Iron has a beautiful architecture. In Iron, the whole application is made up with a few middlewares. That's pretty much like [Clojure's Ring](https://github.com/ring-clojure/ring). In Iron, everything is middleware, you can choose your own composition of middlewares. \n\nFor example, \n- the route middleware dispatches requests to different handlers\n- the body reader middleware parses http request body and transform them into data structures easier to deal with\n- [my handlebars template](https://github.com/sunng87/handlebars-iron) middleware renders data models into web pages\n\nThe middleware architecture splits your code by its functionality, made it easier to test.\n\nNickel is more like nodejs's express framework, it's an all-in-one framework comparing to Iron. It has most essential components in web development built-in. I have never use nickel, but I used to investigate the possibility for making handlebars template engine work for it, and failed. \n\nI'm not saying which one is better. To me, Iron is simpler, while Nickel seems easier. And personally I like the Iron design.\n"

Alternatively since `PathBuf` implements `Deref` into `Path` can one or the other variant just be discarded (I'm still a bit fuzzy on how `Deref` works)?\n"

However I don't see a way to do that from a `iron::request::Body`.\n"

Instead the author there says it's \"just the right thing to do\" to credit the dependencies' author in the UI.\n\nThe other \"case study\" he vaguely mentioned are Android apps that have MIT dependencies:\n\n> see many google android apps with long lists of MIT attributions\n\nbut the apps that I have seen give credits to all dependencies, MIT-licensed or not.\n\nFurthermore I have a serious problem with how this proposal is formulated, and the rhetoric used to convice crate authors to switch licenses. @cmr claims [MIT-licensed libraries will not be used in software at all](https://github.com/untitaker/rust-atomicwrites/issues/11#issuecomment-170365577):\n\n> the actual implication is that your crate won't get used in dual MIT/Apache-2.0 codebases, which is largely what the Rust ecosystem has settled on.\n\nand makes it seem like the choice of MIT/Apache is a dogma in the Rust community. In [another issue](https://github.com/SimonSapin/rust-forest/issues/3), he paddles back, saying it's a rather \"theoretical problem\".\n\nApart from that I have never seen anybody else make comparably strong claims. It's never been an issue in any software I've ever worked on, and enough software with MIT-dependencies (or 3-clause BSD, which has similar conditions)  is deployed without replicating the copyright claims in their GUIs.\n"

Thank you very much for making this change, it's something I've wanted to do for a long time.\n\nThere's only one major thing I think we should change: many of the methods return owned types (`String`, `Vec<String>`, etc.) by internally calling cloning methods when we could just return the borrowed variant. Wherever possible, I would like to avoid adding any allocations by just returning the borrowed type instead.\n\nI think the only remaining refactor would be substituting String for a proper error type, but that can be left for another PR.\n"

This is waaay simpler and more elegant a change than my own attempt at this, too. One thing - I'm not super thrilled with exposing hyper's implementation details this way, as it means I have to add hyper to my Cargo.toml and make sure to specify the same version hyper uses (is there a workaround for this?)\n"

        "body": "Hi!\n\n[`req.extensions.get`](http://ironframework.io/doc/iron/typemap/struct.TypeMap.html#method.get) captures `&self`, so `req` itself is immutably borrowed for the rest of the scope (in this case, the rest of the function). [`req.get_ref`](http://ironframework.io/doc/iron/prelude/trait.Pluggable.html#method.get_ref) tries to capture `&mut self`, but `req` cannot be mutably borrowed while any other borrows (mutable _or_ mutable) are active.\n\n`Pluggable`, through which `params::Map` is accessed, requires `&mut self`. For Iron's sake, this is nice because it allows plugins to \"mutate\" the request (in this case, reading from the request body stream to extract parameters).\n\nAnyway, a simple fix would be to reverse the order of the `let connection` and `let payload` lines; `payload` itself doesn't hold on to a reference of `req`, but `connection` does.\n\nOr, you may be interested in dropping usage of the `extensions` `TypeMap` altogether and using a `Plugin` to access the database. [Here's one example](https://github.com/superlogical/rustwebapp/blob/master/src/main.rs#L132) that uses Iron's `persistent` crate, which uses `Arc` internally to help you avoid these borrow/lifetime ergonomics issues.\n\nI'm not 100% sure if it's the intentional semantics of Iron, but `req.extensions` seems to be used for storing _pre-calculated data_ specifically for communication between middleware (such as with Iron's `router` middleware). Plugins are suited for _lazy evaluation_, and can also provide caching for the resultant data. `params` is a plugin because not all requests need to access request parameters, so they should only be deserialized when requested. In many ways, I think it's semantically correct for database access to be through plugins.\n\nSorry, I think I'm babbling. :smile: Hopefully this shed some light on your situation.\n"

        "body": "I spent some time investigating this and it really comes down to the Body being problematic. To avoid pushing all the async stuff into Iron the request body needs to either be entirely in memory or entirely on disk. As an alternative perhaps a continuation can be returned as a IronResult specifying it needs the Body to begin with. In all scenarios Body is no longer the same as it is in Iron 0.3\n\nThe in memory/on disk scenario I could see playing out basically where if the request body is extraordinarily large, its written to disk before being given. This is troublesome though because, what size is the maximum allowed? What's the cutoff for in memory or on disk?\n\nThe continuation method seems saner. Providing a closure as an IronResult, lets call it a ReadBody IronResult for the sake of examples takes read chunks of the body as a parameter...\n\nSo basically something like...\n\n``` rust\nfn some_handler(req: IronRequest) -> IronResult { \n     let request_handler = SomeHandler::new(req);\n    IronResult::ReadBody(move |chunk| { request_handler.handle_chunk(chunk) }) \n}\n```\n\nNot quite as nice as the std::io::Read for sure, but without something akin to co-routines...\n"

I imagine if you try `curl http://[::1]:<port>`, it will succeed for Iron but fail for your other services.\n\nA quick fix for this behavior is to remove the entry for `::1` from your `/etc/hosts` (adding `::1 localhost` to mine makes me able to reproduce this), but I wonder why there are local differences between several applications wrt preference of IPv4 vs IPv6.\n"

It is a trait defined in hyper, but in the implementation block in iron.rs it is not fully implemented. However in the hello_world example, we pass a Request closure to the new function instead of a Handler. I checked in the [hyper docs](http://ironframework.io/doc/iron/request/struct.Request.html) and it Request doesn't implement Handler.\nAny help on this would be appreciated.\n"

If Iron wants to wrap that in the future, that can always change.\r\n\r\nThere are two issues remaining before I can get an async Iron working:\r\n  - [x] Hyper removed SSL support, so I'm not sure how we want to handle it.  I think if another library exposes an ssl layer to tokio, it would be easy to wrap Hyper in that.  I'll investigate that later.\r\n  - [ ] My first attempt at an AsyncHandler trait looked like: ```fn async_handle(&self, &mut Request) -> BoxIronFuture<Response>;```.  However, when trying to implement AsyncHandler for Handler, the compiler was not happy about the TypeMap in Response as Response needs to be Send (which TypeMap isn't).  Trying to change the TypeMap to a SendMap then breaks the integration with the plugin crate, and trying to change plugin to be generic over all the different TypeMaps is turning out to be very difficult.  I think a few projects rely on this functionality, so I'll continue to try chasing this down."

Due to the way dependency works, I'm not sure having the native-tls-example feature is, as native-tls now a direct dependency through tokio-tls.\r\n\r\nI'm also not sure if the complexity of Iron::https is worth the simplification of Iron::listen.  My initial implementation of listen instead took a stream of futures that returned emitted the Io object.  listen could easily wait on the future without blocking the thread, but it meant the http function need to wrap every TcpStream in a future.  I've posted an initial version here: https://github.com/MJDSys/iron/blob/async2/src/iron.rs#L123 .  If you prefer that version, let me know and I'll update the last commit."

It seems to me pretty common that a request is not read (i.e. early return from middleware because some session header/cookie was not present.). Unclear what the timeline is for the release of that async branch of hyper.\r\n\r\nMaybe closing the connection when there is still data left to read after a request is done? I've implemented an after chain that reads data left on requests as a `link_after`, and it seems to have fixed it where I was running into it. This is not ideal since it could end up reading data forever (the reason https://github.com/hyperium/hyper/commit/5f432851882c6f5e2dbf4efea464978bc4d88700 was reverted), and I think it doesn't solve the early return case."

The fix would be fairly difficult to do, and resources aren't really dedicated at the 0.10.x branch anymore.\r\n\r\nThe fix in async was basically to just close the connection if the full body wasn't read. It's the sanest default.\r\n\r\nAs for the bug, if I recall correctly, the only thing really happens is an error log line is generated and then the connection is dropped, when it tries to parse the remaining body as a new request."

I was suggesting iron could maybe drop the connection if it was not read all the way -- the `Request` object does not expose a way to do this, but thought maybe iron had a way to do this internally.\r\n\r\n@seanmonstar: interesting. the way this manifests in iron is that the remaining data from the original request becomes part of the method for the following request. See output in [the gist above](https://gist.github.com/matthauck/58756f0be5907673ded2254fba59f07a#file-log-txt). Maybe there is actually a bug in how iron is handling this beyond the known issue in sync hyper?\r\n"

For requests, I've tried stepping around this by moving in a ```Request``` instead of passing a ```&mut Request```, and producing a ```Request``` as part of the output.  I'm not super happy about this though, as it leaks the details of the ```Chain``` into ```async_handle```'s interface.  Also there is now an ugly tuple to return.  The trait is currently:\r\n```rust\r\n/// `AsyncHandler`s are responsible for handling all requests by returning a future that yields the actual response.\r\npub trait AsyncHandler: Send + 'static {\r\n    /// Produce a `Future` that handles the given request that produces an appropriate response or error.\r\n    fn async_handle(&self, Request) -> BoxIronFuture<(Request, Response)>;\r\n}\r\n\r\n// where BoxIronFuture is a helper type defined as:\r\npub type BoxIronFuture<T> = Box<futures::Future<Item=T, Error=IronError>>;\r\n```\r\n\r\nHowever, if anything in ```&self``` is needed, it needs to be cloned into the future.  This is a problem implementing Chain, as the ```Vec```s of middleware are needed to decide how to proceed, but I can't keep a reference to them.  I've currently fixed it by avoiding ```BoxFuture,``` which requires the ```Future``` to be ```Send``` (since we are not currently sending the future across threads, which I'm not sure is a valid assumption?).  I then store a ```Vec<Rc<*Middleware>>``` instead of ```Vec<Box<*Middleware>>```, but I'm not super happy about that.  If I use ```BoxFuture, Vec<Arc<*Middleware>>``` isn't enough, as ```*Middleware``` isn't ```Sync```.  I'm not sure if it's a problem to require ```*Middleware``` to be ```Sync``` though.\r\n\r\nI tried making the ```&self``` in ```async_handle``` ```'static```, but due to Hyper not allowing its handler to be ```'static```, that doesn't work.  So it seems I'm stuck with an ```Rc```.\r\n\r\nI'm thinking the ```Vec<Rc<*>>``` needs to be a ```Rc<Vec<Box<*>>>``` to avoid some ```Box<Future<>>``` in ```Chain```, but that's an optimization with a separate discussion.\r\n\r\nAlso reem/rust-plugin#14 remains a problem.  For now, I've removed the ```Extensible``` implementation and used a ```SendMap``` directly."

Are there any strong objections to it (don't want to waste time on a PR that'll be rejected on philosophical ground)?\n> \n> -- \n> You are receiving this because you modified the open/close state.\n> Reply to this email directly or view it on GitHub:\n> https://github.com/iron/iron/issues/536#issuecomment-294297974\n"

Alternately, this could go in with the openssl dependency so people can start experimenting, and we fix it before release.  I'd be happy to help with that effort too."

        "body": "Ok, this PR is updated against the latest hyper release.  The only remaining problem is ssl.  My problem is that there is no generic tls mechanism for tokio, and tokio doesn't provide a generic way do deal with listeners.\r\n\r\nIron::listen at least allows for someone to construct their own tls handler on top of a TcpListener without having to deal with Hyper.  One improvement may be to return the server future, to avoid taking in the tokio reactor, but I'm not sure if that is useful.  I'm happy to implement any ideas people come up with.\r\n\r\nOne last idea: I could have Iron convert into an IronService (in replacement for RawService) (or have Iron implement NewService somehow), so someone could setup their own instance of hyper, and use Iron on top.  I'm not sure about this though."

        "body": "The current tokio-proto design is built with some sort of idea of middleware, coming from 2 different sides of the server problem.\r\n\r\n1. `ServerProto`: These are the things that receive some IO object, and process it into a `Request` and `Response` (not necessarily HTTP), and give those things to a `Service`. This is what `hyper::server::Http` is. A system of `ServerProto` middleware can exist. In fact, hyper's is one of them. There can exist other `ServerProto`s that are generic over one they wrap, such as the `TlsServer` in tokio-tls.\r\n\r\n2. `Service`: These are the middlewares that process the `Request`/`Response` pair, not really dealing with the underlying IO object. Since Iron is built around the idea of middleware, it may make sense to be able to use any `Service` wrapper. This allows something like the following:\r\n    \r\n    ```rust\r\n    let router = iron::Router::new(map_of_routes); // impl Service\r\n    let timed = foo::Timed::new(thirty_seconds, router); // impl Service\r\n    let log = iron::Log::new(log_opts, timed); // impl Service\r\n    return log;\r\n    ````\r\n\r\n----\r\n\r\nAll this to say, you could make `Iron` implement `ServerProto`. Maybe it takes an `Http`, maybe that's not exposed, I don't really know. But that'd allow others to chose to use `TcpServer`, or `TlsServer`, or `UnixServer`, or `QuicServer`, or whatever.\r\n\r\nIf you wanted an \"easy mode\", you could make `Iron::listen` wrap itself in a `TcpServer` or something."

        "body": "Hi all,\r\n\r\nSorry this took a while to come back to.  I was working to understand how tokio-proto worked with hyper (it all makes sense now, but there are some unclear parts from just reading documentation/implemented traits).  Anyways, now the Iron struct directly implements the NewService trait, which makes it trivial to work with hyper/tokio-proto, which can be seen in the http/https methods and the hello_custom_config example.\r\n\r\nThe around example no longer works as expected though, as the server is started as soon as http/https is called, and thus only a single server is started.  If it's ok that the http/https methods start the server and never return, I'll fix the example to configure LoggerMode based on an argument.\r\n\r\nIf wanted I can clean up the git history some to reduce the number of commits, but I figured getting the newest version of the code out was more important.\r\n\r\nAlso, what is the status on #533?  Should that land before this?  As I mentioned, that shouldn't be a problem and I can easily fix up my history to be formatted appropriately after it lands."

App developers and middleware developers will use this API and never care about actual server impl. It can be great if the API is independent to underlying implementation, for example, does not involve hyper types like Body, while keep the performance. Consider it as the serde crate for Iron.\n* **Iron-Server**: Keep track with latest Hyper/Tokio/Futures development to ensure backend solid and up to date.\n* **Iron-middlewares**: keep some essential middlewares maintained and released together just like the stdlib.\n"

I had originally filed the bug there (https://github.com/TheWaWaR/simple-http-server/issues/16) but upon further analysis found it to be a problem in `iron`. \r\n\r\nThe version of `iron` they are using is `^0.5.0`. The code around line 130 in `response.rs` which I've referred to above is slightly different in version `0.5.0` compared to the `master`, but I think the effective behaviour is the same in both versions (I presume)."
