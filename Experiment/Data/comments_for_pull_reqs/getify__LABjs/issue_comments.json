        "body": "dynamic script loading completely de-couples script loading (normally done with script tags) from the window's dom-ready and onload events. That's the \"Blocking\" in LABjs name in fact, that it removes (by default) such blocking behavior.\n\nThere's actually no way for any dynamic script loader of this nature to guarantee dom-ready/onload blocking when scripts are loading. So, essentially, those two events will proceed independent of whether a script loads quickly (from cache) or slowly (over the net).\n\nThe problem you're describing was, in a similar fashion, present in jQuery prior to version 1.4, in that jQuery was not, when loaded, checking if dom-ready had _already_ passed when it was loaded. As such, there was a race condition, that if jQuery got there before dom-ready, all the $(document).ready(...) waiting blocks worked. But if jQuery came in after dom-ready, and it didn't check for that, those waiting blocks would all just sit there forever hoping dom-ready would happen.\n\nStarting with jQuery 1.4+, the code base checks for a passed dom-ready by looking for document.readyState, which (for the most part) resolves this problem. In conjunction, because FF before 3.6 didn't have this property, LABjs added a little page-level hack to make that property present, so that the jQuery check would work correctly.\n\nA similar thing seems to be happening with your checking for \"onload\". The logic (I'm guessing) inside Event.observe(...) is simply waiting to hear if onload happens, and if it does, it fires. But I'm betting that onload is firing before this listener gets a chance to register, thus meaning it just waits forever in vain.\n\nThere's no \"window.loaded\" property to rely on like there was for dom-ready with \"readyState\", so the situation is a little tougher/more manual to correct for.\n\nBasically, my suggestion would be something like this:\n\n```\nvar isWindowLoaded = false;\nEvent.observe(window,'load',function(){ isWindowLoaded = true; });\n\n$LAB.script(\"...blah.js\").wait(function(){\n   if (isWindowLoaded) {\n      doSomethingNow();\n   }\n   else {\n      Event.observe(window,'load',doSomethingNow);\n   }\n});\n```\n\nThe key is to have an event listener that executes immediately during page-load (not in waiting for something to happen inside LABjs) that looks for when the \"onload\" happens... if it happens before $LAB has a chance to run, it sets a boolean property to true, so that when the $LAB.wait(...) call runs, it will see that the event has already passed and it'll just proceed immediately. Otherwise, it knows it needs to still wait for the event, so it registers a handler and waits for it to occur.\n\nI hope this is helpful. Let me know if you have other issues.\n"

It can crash IE, and the behavior of seeing the page go blank is quite expected when document.write() runs after a page is loaded.\n\nThe solution is to load scriptaculous manually, then load any other files that don't have document.write() in them with LABjs.\n\nI really wish the frameworks would get their act together (like jQuery did) and get rid of this junk that makes dynamic loading impossible.\n"

        "body": "ok, so what i've narrowed down so far is this:\n\nthe reason you are seeing this behavior (which I'll loosely call a \"bug\") is because the dupe-checks don't fully work they way you'd probably expect between independent $LAB chains. Moreover, if you have an entire chain that loads all scripts which have already been loaded before, that seems to be what exposes this issue. If I add even one non-dupe to the nested $LAB chain (inside javascript.js), things load and execute fine.\n\nThe reason I say \"bug\" and not bug is because I'm not sure that I would necessarily say that the usage you're doing is an intended supported use case. The dupe-check in general was always a more problematic and basically not recommended feature. It was not really designed to be used across chains like you are doing, as it raises very sticky race conditions. It was certainly not designed to basically work that an entire $LAB chain would be ignored and a final .wait() would be the only executable item, which is essentially what this amounts to. Similarly, $LAB.wait(func); also is not a supported usage, for probably a similar reason.\n\nAt this point, I'm not sure if I'll be able to resolve this or not. I've reopened this bug, and as I get time I'll look into it.\n\nIf it helps, my suspicion is that the problem is related to the nested chain having the internal \"first_pass\" boolean staying true when it should eventually cycle to false. I haven't verified this yet, but knowing what I know about the brittle parts of the code, I think it's a decent candidate.\n"

        "body": "many people have asked for this before. i have no plans to add it to LABjs at the moment, and here's why:\n1. actually determining if a dynamically loaded CSS file has finished loading is actually quite complicated and challenging to do cross-browser. The \"load\" events don't fire as one would hope/expect. so adding such support would add a non-trivial size to LABjs (or to a LABjs wrapper/plugin).\n2. I actually find it very rare that people need to sequence the loading (and \"executing\") of CSS in between the loading of other scripts. It's very common that someone says \"I want to load these scripts and this CSS file\" for widgets and things, but very rare that someone says \"I need to load this script, THEN this CSS file, THEN this other script .... \" LABjs is specifically for loading things in parallel and sequencing their execution for dependency sake. So it makes much less sense to mix in CSS loading (which usually doesn't need sequencing) into the API. Would be very much more confusing.\n3. Just the dynamic loading portion (not the load-detection or execution sequencing) of CSS files is actually _very_ easy to do. The code is like this:\n   \n   var link = document.createElement(\"link\");\n   link.setAttribute(\"rel\",\"stylesheet\");\n   link.setAttribute(\"type\",\"text/css\");\n   link.setAttribute(\"href\",\"http://link/to/file.css\");\n   document.getElementsByTagName(\"head\")[0].appendChild(link);\n\nBecause that code is so trivially easy for people to do themselves if they want to load CSS dynamically, I don't think it belongs in a tool which is designed for the specific purpose of performance-efficient script loading.\n\nAll this having been said, some other loaders do support CSS loading... like Dominoes and RequireJS.\n"

Perhaps the re-write I'm working on will be more robust for it, but honestly that won't be a major design goal.\n\nMay I ask, why do you need to resume the $LAB chain later?

Right now, I detect if a URL is absolute by looking for file:// or http:// or https:// at the beginning... I suppose I could add a second check for just // at the beginning, and then have that add on the page's protocol. \n\nI think the reason why I didn't implement this originally was worry that people would accidentally have \"//\" instead of \"/\" at the beginning of the URL (common issues with escaping and such in various templating engines) and instead of getting a root-relative path, they'd get an invalid path. Hmmm... will do more thinking to see if there's a way to protect and serve this use-case simultaneously.\n\nI'll probably add that to the list of to-do's for the rewrite that's in progress.

So if you do it that way, be careful and test thoroughly.\n\nAnother approach, which should be a little more solid, but is based on a very similar concept (simulated chaining) is found here:\n\nhttps://gist.github.com/704226\n\n-OR-\n\nhttps://gist.github.com/475431\n"

        "body": "Initially, it was an important design decision for LABjs to have each $LAB chain completely independent. This is still currently my philosophy and it precludes features which deliberately tie the chains together, even for a single callback.\n\nSyntactically, it introduces an API complexity/confusion that is undesirable. If $LAB.ready() fires when all current chains are done, what happens if you start another $LAB chain after it (or inside it)... will it clear out that event? Lots of issues arise in this line of questioning.\n\nBasically, I'm not convinced that the use-case for multiple chains is all that strong (except in a few scenarios), and so I encourage people to consolidate their code into as few chains as possible. Really, you shouldn't have _any_ code in separate chains if that code has any relationship to code being loaded in another chain. There's [\"simulated chaining\"](https://gist.github.com/475431) (with a for-loop) if you have the need to build up parts of a chain in contextually separate blocks of code and run the chain all at once once the chains parts are all known.\n\nSo, while I've thought about a $LAB.ready() thing before, I think it's counter to the philosophy, API design, and best-practices that are put forth from LABjs.\n\nI'm not aware of any use-case that would be a strong argument for such a thing... can you explain why you think it's necessary?\n"

Indeed, I thought that the browser is fast enough (or there is a small delay before $LAB.ready()) so that all $LAB.script() are called (that mean LABjs knows all scripts in the page) before $LAB.ready().\n\nWhen you ask about this case, I know that I'm wrong ;-) because your decision is \"as fast as the browser will allow\", then there is no delay... But I wonder if a few ms delay for $LAB.ready() could be enough so that all $LAB.script() are called before .ready()?\n\nIn a page there are many JS: some is in header, some is in footer, some is in the content for inline ads (the availability of JS depends on content, not on page, not all content have ads). But in fact I can postprocess to consolidate all JS file in one call, reorder JS (normally ads JS does not depend on other JS, thus it is placed 1st). So, currently I don't have any use case for multiple chain, it's just for convenient.\n\nThanks for your help. FYI I've created a new project page to enable LABjs in Drupal automatically http://drupal.org/project/labjs . Version for Drupal 7 was out, for Drupal 6 is coming soon. Maybe there will be more use cases.\n"

The two links I've sent you above show exactly how to do that.\n"

        "body": "i undersstand that you only want to load some scripts with LABjs. as far as i'm concerned, if you have to, that's fine. if there's a script that has a document.write in it, you should definitely only load that with a regular script tag. (hint: you shold also pressure the creator of that script to stop using document.write()... it's terrible for performance!) \n\nif you're wanting is to have a regular script block in the markup have some waiting affect on the code you're loading with LABjs, this is not possible. the definition of a dynamic script loader is that it makes script loading independent from the page's other resource loading (including manual script tags).\n\nif you're just wanting to sometimes use the queueing (for LABjs loadable scripts) and other times not, do something like this:\n\n```\n<!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC \"-//W3C//DTD XHTML+RDFa 1.0//EN\">\n<html xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\">\n<head><title>TTCN D7 test</title>\n<script src=\"http://d7.ttcn/sites/all/libraries/labjs/LAB.min.js?lenopg\"></script>\n<script type=\"text/javascript\">$LAB.setGlobalDefaults({AlwaysPreserveOrder:true});</script>\n...\n<script>$LAB.queue(\"http://d7.ttcn/file1.js\");</script>\n...\n<script src=\"http://partner.googleadservices.com/gampad/google_service.js\"></script>\n...\n<script>$LAB.queue(function() {\n  alert(0);\n});</script>\n...\n</head>\n<body>Test</body>\n...\n<script>$LAB.executeQueue();</script>\n</html>\n```\n\nAs for how, in your original markup, to distinguish what code should be queued for LABjs and what should be left alone, have it be something like this as the original markup before you alter it with your Drupal module:\n\n```\n<!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC \"-//W3C//DTD XHTML+RDFa 1.0//EN\">\n<html xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\">\n<head><title>TTCN D7 test</title>\n...\n<script rel=\"LABjs\" src=\"http://d7.ttcn/file1.js\"></script>\n...\n<script src=\"http://partner.googleadservices.com/gampad/google_service.js\"></script>\n...\n<script rel=\"LABjs\">\n  alert(0);\n</script>\n...\n</head>\n<body>Test</body>\n</html>\n```\n\nSo, your original markup just starts off with script blocks strewn throughout, like shown. For the script blocks where you want LABjs to attach and queue (either for an external `src` loading, or for an inline snippet), you just mark the tag with something like `rel=\"LABjs\"`, that way your Drupal module knows it should rewrite that tag. And you inject the LABjs loading at the beginning, including the setting of global defaults, and you inject the `executeQueue()` call at the very bottom of the page.\n\nI dunno if this helps or not, but that's how I'd approach a CMS module for LABjs.\n"

        "author_association": "OWNER",
        "body": "First of all, your code snippet looks a little incorrect to me. So let me correct it:\n\n```\n<script src=\"lab.js\"></script>\n<script>\n$LAB.setOptions({AlwaysPreserveOrder:true})\n  .script(\"jquery.js\")\n  .script(\"core.js\")\n  .wait(function(){ List.F1 = ... })\n  .wait(function(){ List.F2 = ... })\n;\n</script>\n```\n\nFirstly, I removed the double-load of \"core.js\". Secondly, you can't run code inside a `script()` statement, only inside a `wait()` statement. Unless what your code was intending to imply is not that actual inline code but the load of a separate file with that code in it, in which case the `script()` call is correct. Lastly, I used the chainable `setOptions()` form of option setting, since your code only shows one chain. If you indeed have other chains in the page, then your `setGlobalDefaults()` usage was more correct.\n\nIf indeed it's two `wait()` calls like I've shown, then you should just combine them into one. But if it's two `script()` calls loading separate files, obviously you keep them separate.\n\n---\n\nWith respect to your question about DOM-ready issues, my suggestion is not to use `$(document).ready()` to defer behavior that is really not related to the document being ready or not. That event should be used to defer behavior that needs to interact with the DOM, like event handling, DOM manip, etc. \n\nMany people have conflated that event with scripts finishing loading, because the regular &lt;script> tag just happens to be blocking that event in browsers. When they move to a script loader that specifically breaks the connection between the two, they're always surprised, and often try to jump through all kinds of hoops to fix restore that connection, many of which are more complicated than I think it should be.\n\nMy rule of thumb is, use DOM-ready event for DOM related things, and use your own \"events\" or callbacks for other purposes. In your case, I'd refactor core.js to remove the `$(document).ready()`, and not have it auto-execute anything. Then, you'd make your chain do this:\n\n```\n<script src=\"lab.js\"></script>\n<script>\n$LAB.setOptions({AlwaysPreserveOrder:true})\n  .script(\"jquery.js\")\n  .script(\"core.js\")\n  .wait(function(){ List.F1 = ... })\n  .wait(function(){ List.F2 = ... })\n  .wait(function(){\n    for each (List as f): run f();\n  })\n;\n</script>\n```\n\n(note: if you indeed end up with multiple subsequent .wait() calls like shown above, combine them if possible to avoid unnecessary waste/overhead)\n\nSo, bottom line, I'm suggesting the more difficult modification of core.js to remove the concept of the autorun as you've shown it, because I think it's a bad pattern to load several scripts that have dependencies on each other, and then rely on DOM-ready to be the \"they're all loaded\" event for you. Even without a script loader like LABjs, this is an error-prone and brittle pattern that should be avoided.\n\nBut especially with a script loader introduced, you should instead use the script loader's facilities for knowing when all scripts are finished running, and then you can execute whatever \"autorun\" behavior you want. This is cleaner and easier code to maintain, and will work solidly.\n"

        "body": "I've considered this (and variations of it) before. Unfortunately, there's one major snag that's prevented me from putting something like that in: the browsers are all over the map in terms of their support for onerror and on not firing onload in error cases. As far as I know, there's no reliable way to guarantee that only an onerror handler will fire if a script fails to load. If both were to fire (as does happen), and in the wrong order (as does happen) it would be a strange and undefined state for the $LAB chain.\n\nAlso, and this is probably more troubling even: in some browsers, like FF and Opera, LABjs does not currently control the execution flow... meaning I could not interrupt the flow of execution (stop it, or inject something into it on-the-fly). The _best_ that could happen there is that you could simply be notified of the failure, but you couldn't do anything to adjust how the rest of the chain was going to work as a result.\n\nI believe the browsers and spec SHOULD standardize the load and error events properly and sanely, so we can do things like this. That's part of what I'm advocating for. But we're a long way off from having that.\n\nI'd welcome any further thoughts on the topic.\n"

        "body": "I appreciate your feedback. I agree with you that the documentation needs some love in both cases that you bring up. I have been kinda putting that off because 2.0 has been in development for awhile, and I planned to refresh the docs once 2.0 came out. Unfortunately, 2.0 has been more delayed than I would have hoped, because of issues with the browser vendors and the HTML spec.\n\nIn any case, I agree it needs attention, and if I can't get 2.0 resolved soon, I'll update the docs to more clearly state the situation as it applies to 1.2 (current release).\n\n---\n\nWith respect to your questions:\n1. Multiple $LAB chains are perfectly fine, and are encouraged. What is not fine, and is discouraged, is using the \"AllowDuplicates:false\" feature and relying on that across multiple chains. As several of the comments/issues threads reveal, this is not reliable. It's a major design goal of 2.0 to fix that. I just simply never considered in 1.x dev that this would be a common use case. Turns out it is.\n\nMoreover, if you're going to use separate chains, it's important to understand that they are in fact quite separate. If there's ever been a case where I implied to avoid them (not in the context of AllowDuplicates), it was almost certainly meant to say \"avoid using separate chains when one chain will do fine.\" This is because many people think that they should be able to load multiple scripts in different chains, and then get some sort of \"All Done\" message across the chains. I have had to explain numerous times that the intentional design of keeping the chains separate not only makes that quite awkward to do, but also violates the intended API design and usage.\n\nTo state more clearly: use indepedent chains when you have completely independent groups of scripts to load. If there's any depdendency at all, such as needing to \"gate\" to wait on both to finish, separate chains is perhaps not the best idea and a single chain is better.\n\nAlso, many people use LABjs in a \"CMS\" fashion, where they programmatically build up their script loading across many inline script blocks that the CMS includes into the final HTML from separate page templates, etc. Again, many people were in the habit of specifying a new chain for each snippet, and then were confused why the order preservation didn't occur. To them, also, I said \"avoid multiple chains\"... what they need is a single chain that they can conditionally build up across snippets, and then execute the whole chain. And for them, I built the \"queue\" mechanism. There's a gist for the \"queue\" functionality, to use now, in 1.2, but it's also going to be a native feature in LABjs 2.0.\n1. Should a chain be \"resumable\" later, meaning you could call .wait() on a chain that had already resolved itself? This is a dicey question. I understand the desire that people have to use the .wait() kinda like a special event emitter like jQuery's DOM-ready, where it will either queue and wait, or immediately fire if the event is already passed. I can understand the attractiveness of that design pattern.\n\nHowever, it partly violates the design principles that I had when building the API. The .wait() is not designed to be an \"event\"... it's a link in the chain when the chain executes. Once a chain finishes executing, resuming from it should really be an undefined behavior.\n\nTechnically, with some bug fixes I did in recent patches to LABjs, calling .wait() on a finished chain might very well work. But it's not really a supported or intended pattern. So I tell people to avoid trying to use the API in that way.\n\nMy answer to \"how do i do it?\" then is, keep track of a separate flag/event-signal externally to LABjs... and set that flag in your chain's final .wait(). When you later want to execute something, it's a simple check to see if the flag is set yet (in that case, execute immediately), or if not, THEN you can append to the in-progress chain, and it should work fine.\n\nThis roughly corresponds to how I'd recommend doing the same thing with jquery's DOM-ready... when you have some code to run, first check the document's readyState... if it's still loading, then queue up your code to wait for DOM-ready. If the document state indicates the DOM-ready has already passed, then you can just safely execute your code right away.\n\n---\n\nAnyway, I hope that dialog helps clear some things up. As I said, I agree that info would be useful in documentation. But, it's tough to figure out the level of detail and explicitness to put in such wording. On one hand, I want to discourage usage-patterns which are against the spirit of the API design... on the other hand, I want to inspire people to wrap $LAB with additional behavior as they see fit. $LAB was always intended to be a bare-bones building block for more complicated dependency management. In both of the questions you've asked above, the intention was that people would create wrappers around $LAB to manage those things. Problems started happening when people tried to massage the native API into doing it, in ways it wasn't intended.\n\nI welcome further feedback on how I can find that right balance for the documentation. In the meantime, I hope others do what you've done, when they have questions.. which is to first read the site documentation, then search the live discussion threads here to see deeper info.\n"

        "body": "With your reassurances and further explanation, it is easier now for me to see that the context of the comment in which you said multiple chains were to be avoided was indeed concerned with cross-thread interdependence. That is very reassuring. And while my own thought process had not gotten that far, your explanation that appending to a chain before it has finished executing should work makes my use case trivial to support; I don't even need to add a separate flag in this particular case...all I need to do is check for the existence of the library function; I can set up the events immediately if it's there, append to the chain that is loading the library otherwise.\n\nIn light of your explanations, I think you could cover the specific points I brought up pretty easily. If you added to the documentation (perhaps rephrased) this passage from your response to me:\n\n> Multiple $LAB chains are perfectly fine, and are encouraged. What is not fine, and is \n> discouraged, is using the \"AllowDuplicates:false\" feature and relying on that across \n> multiple chains.

I just simply never considered in \n> 1.x dev that this would be a common use case. Turns out it is.\n\n...and added one simple example in which you set a flag as you describe, then check for it later to determine whether to execute immediately or append to the chain (with the note that appending to an already-completed chain is unsupported behavior, and may not continue to work even if it currently does), I think you'd have covered both points sufficiently for most people. Certainly sufficiently for me.\n\nOn the other hand, depending on how close the 2.0 release looms, this issue and its comments...and the explicit mention I'm making now that this conversation took place at version 1.2...may be plenty. I'm inclined to think that the target audience of LABjs is probably largely composed of people who would find this if they ran into any difficulty.\n"

        "body": "\"because document.ready may take awhile to fire...\"\n\nUmm, `document.ready` fires pretty darn quick most of the time... it maybe takes a browser a few dozen milliseconds to parse the DOM and get DOMContentLoaded fired. `window.onload` may take longer, yes, because it has to wait on images to finish loading, etc. But in most cases, `document.ready` will fire quite quickly. The only known things that block `document.ready` are actual markup &lt;script> tags, but since you're using LABjs you probably don't have many or any of those. So, as long as you have your DOM pretty clean of stuff like that (you should anyway, for general user-experience), then `document.ready` will fire very quickly.\n\nMoreover, you shouldn't be making the assumption that just because you have a &lt;script> tag appearing after some DOM element, that this guarantees that the DOM element is ready for you to mess with. This is a common but flawed assumption. There are a number of factors (and older browsers) which invalidate that assumption. The best-practice and by far safer approach is to not do anything that interacts with your DOM until DOM-ready has fired.\n\n\"...furthermore, the point of this is decoupling the functions you call for a given dependency from the actual loading of them.\"\n\nThat may be _your_ point, but it's fundamentally opposite of the design goal of LABjs. LABjs is specifically about coupling your script loading to \"inline\" script logic, so that all your external and inline scripts will fire in the correct order, even though they are loading in parallel.\n\nThe primary/majority use-case for LABjs is not compatible with what you suggest. This is not something I forsee changing the API to support.\n"

        "body": "\"...I don't actually know whether or not I will want to call do_stuff() later in the page.\"\n\nSpecifically to this point, jQuery's implementation of `document.ready` is capable of doing what you suggest... you can have your code to interact with the DOM element wrapped, like so\n\n```\n$(document).ready(function(){ do_stuff(); });\n```\n\nAnd that code snippet can be called at any time in the life of the page, even minutes later. If DOM-ready has already passed, it'll execute right away. If DOM-ready hasn't passed yet, it'll wait for DOM-ready.\n\nThe only part of the scenario that YOU want that isn't possible with only the LABjs API, is a flag that tells you if a script has finished loading. Consider something like this, then:\n\n```\n<script>\nfunction func() {\n   $(document).ready(function(){ do_stuff(); });\n}\n\nvar framework_loaded = false, $L;\n$L = $LAB.script('framework.js').wait(function(){ \n   framework_loaded = true;\n});\n</script>\n\n... <div id='important'></div> ....\n\n<script>\n// at some later time, either during the \n// loading of the page, or much later, like \n// when a user clicks some button, etc\n          if (framework_loaded) func()\n          else $L.wait(func);\n</script>\n```\n\nPerhaps that comes closer to what you want to accomplish.\n"

        "body": "Thanks for the well-thought-out response.\n1. `document.ready` can actually take a long time. We have pages that can take awhile to render, but because we flush() html incrementally, people can actually use the page before domready fires.\n2. Assuming DOM elements are usable: I was aware of some issues with unclosed elements and IE6, but nothing else. We don't support IE6 anymore (~1% of traffic). What else is there? Because DOM ready is a lot of hocus-pocus in the major implementations anyway, it doesn't seem like it should make a big difference. You may have more experience than I do with this...What bugs have you seen?\n3. Hmm...Maybe we don't understand each other. I want to couple inline scripts to external scripts and make them fire in the correct order. That is definitely my goal. However, I don't want to have to place my inline scripts in the same place as my LABjs code. It seems to me I should still be able to have the labjs semantics of firing in the correct order but without putting all the code in the same place. It's easy to hack what I want by saying:\n   \n   ```\n   FrameReady = [];\n   $LAB.script('framework.js').wait(function() {\n       FrameReady.each(function(func) { func() });\n       FrameReady = { push : function(func) { func(); };\n   });\n   ```\n\nThen anywhere I want I can say `FrameReady.push(do_stuff)` and have it fire either instantly if framework.js is loaded or if not, as soon as it does load. However, I don't want to write this code for any given $LAB.script() load.\n"

Rework your code to only use a single chain (sometimes possible, especially with the \"queueing\" add-on).\n2.

LABjs is all about loading a JS file and executing it, so loading other non-JS resources is really outside the scope of what the library is focused on. Of course, you can do XHR to load external templates yourself. The code to load and inject is pretty small, maybe 10-15 lines of code.\n"

LABjs _could_ have logic in it that basically says, if the \"type\" is not \"text/javascript\", i'll only load it locally with XHR, and do an \"injection\" as normal. But then, the question is, how should the LABjs API respond if you ask for it from a cross-domain? (remember, it's quite common for people to host files on CDN's)\n\nI could refuse to load it, or throw some error, or something like that. But it complicates the API and makes it harder to use.\n\nI think the biggest problem is, people want to use LABjs as a \"resource loader\" when in fact, LABjs is only focused on being the best \"JavaScript loader\"... templates, CSS, etc... those are all good resources to load, but they're not the focus of LABjs.\n"

        "body": "LABjs does not support a native behavior to \"disable caching\". In fact, in some browsers, LABjs explicitly relies on caching for its preloading (as do most other loaders).\n\nThe behavior you describe is a well-known \"issue\", where the browser won't re-validate dynamically loaded resources under some conditions, forcing you to clear your cache and refresh, instead of a shift+refresh that would normally revalidate and reload changed resources. The behavior is quite unfortunate for developers who use dynamic resource loaders. I am personally tracking a couple of bugs at both Webkit and Chrome for this exact problem (and other browsers have it too). What we're asking for is a \"super refresh\" where all resources will unconditionally be revalidated, regardless of how they were loaded. I hope the browsers give us that soon.\n\nFor the time being, in development, the best I can suggest is:\n1. Disable preloading with `UsePreloading:false` (the other parameters are unnecessary, as this one trumps them).\n2. Append a \"cache bust\" param to the end of every URL, like `\"?_\"+Math.random()`, to force the browser to reload the resource new every page load.\n\nThis is of course terrible behavior/performance, and should only be used for development. In production, turn Preloading back on and don't add the cache-busting param.\n"

        "body": "I appreciate your time to explain your request for LABjs. I'm not really sure this use-case fits cleanly onto the intended API philosophy for LABjs. What you're asking for is a valid, but rather niche, use-case, which is two separate scripts that:\n1. have a common script (or scripts) as dependencies in the upstream of the chain; AND\n2. download in parallel; AND\n3. execute in first-come-first-served order; AND\n4. each has a different set of coupled-code that should execute after it finishes\n\nIt's specifically #4 which throws the wrench into the general design philosophy of LABjs, which is to organize trees of loading logic into separate, single-path branches (chains). Because you're basically trying to create a conditional-branching path chain with coupled code execution.\n\nIn LABjs' design philosophy (and achieving by default the maximum parallel loading performance), you can have 1+2+3 or 2+3+4, but not really 1+2+3+4.\n\n1+2+3:\n    $LAB.script(\"a.js\").wait()\n    .script(\"b.js\")\n    .script(\"c.js\")\n    .wait(...);\n\n2+3+4:\n    // notice, no upstream \"a.js\" dependency\n    $LAB.script(\"b.js\").wait(init_b); // these are totally separate chains, and thus execute first-come-first-served\n    $LAB.script(\"c.js\").wait(init_c);\n\nSo, how do we get 1+2+3+4:\n    $LAB.script(\"a.js\").wait(function(){\n        $LAB.script(\"b.js\").wait(init_b); // these are totally separate chains\n        $LAB.script(\"c.js\").wait(init_c);\n    });\n\nThis will work ok. BUT, it has the disadvantage that b.js and c.js will not be downloading in parallel with a.js. So, you lose some performance with that pattern. So that's the caveat with the 1+2+3+4 niche of use-cases.\n\n## Also of note... some browsers (FF, Opera) do not support the use-case of first-come-first-served execution , if any of the scripts are remote, without exceptional hacks (extreme brittle cache preloading) that LABjs does not employ. So this feature use-case would be irrelevant (meaning \"b.js\" would ALWAYS execute before, and thus block execution of, \"c.js\") for users in those browsers in that case. In general, I don't design a functionality unless it can reasonably be supported cross-browser.\n\nThe question remains... should I extend (and complicate) LABjs to support this use-case (for IE/Webkit)? In general, I'm leaning toward \"no\". I think it's a rarer use-case in the broad scope of things, with the additional negative of being limited to only some browsers. Simplicity of code (leads to smaller, faster loading code) _and_ simplicity of API design call for minimalism and for trying to serve, generally, the majority use-cases.\n\nThis is all to say, it's not an outright no, but I'd have to be more convinced that the use-case is less niche than it seems to me at the moment. I'd have to be convinced that the performance degradation of the workaround I provided is worse than the extra baggage of baking this natively into LABjs. If you find more concrete examples of why this is a necessary addition, please do share.\n"

        "body": "In your scenario, you didn't address why \"slider.js\" and \"lightbox.js\" have to be able to be initialized in \"first-come-first-served\" order... that's the specific part that I think makes your use-case more niche.\n\nLABjs will in fact run the files themselves in that fastest-first order (in IE/Webkit), if you do:\n\n```\n$LAB\n.script(\"jquery.js\").wait()\n.script(\"slider.js\")\n.script(\"lightbox.js\")\n.wait(function(){\n    init_slider();\n    init_lightbox();\n });\n```\n\nBut they won't initialize until both of them are ready to initialize. You still however get the most benefit out loading your scripts in parallel (all 3 will load in parallel), and the only tradeoff is that the initialization of one of the plugins may be held up until both are ready to initialize.\n\nBut, I'd argue this is better UX in general, for end users, rather than to have part of the page initialize but another part of the page be still unusable. When I go to sites like that, it's frustrating to me.\n\nKeep in mind: LABjs' simple design goal is to make loading and executing of scripts as fast as possible (for the general case). It's not so much about making scripts run as soon as humanly possible.\n\nIf two scripts really are completely independent, you can achieve complete separation by doing the separate chains. If they're not independent, then I think it's more trouble than it's worth (from the code and API perspective) to support this mixed mode where there's sort of run-time conditional dependencies within the chain.\n\nAs stated before, the other possible tradeoff to make is:\n\n```\n$LAB\n.script(\"jquery.js\").wait(function(){\n    $LAB.script(\"slider.js\").wait(init_slider);\n    $LAB.script(\"lightbox.js\").wait(init_lightbox);\n });\n```\n\nThat basically accomplishes what you want, except that the plugins wait to download until after jquery loads.\n\nI think either of those two (while a slight compromise performance wise) is a decent concession/work-around while preserving the design philosophy of the LABjs API.\n\n> Hmm, couldnt this possibly be solved for the hosting-yourself case, by xmlhttprequest the items, and then eval them?\n\nYes, you can easily accomplish it with XHR, if all the scripts in question are local. However, LABjs is focused on the general case, where some or all scripts come from remote locations. As such, it has to assume that it may not be able to use XHR.\n\nI generally don't design a feature for LABjs that only works if you happen to choose all your scripts to be local, because all the other people who use LABjs where some scripts are not local don't benefit from the feature, and in fact, in some cases, a feature may outright not work for them. So, I only consider features which have reasonable behavior for the general \"worst-case\" type scenario.\n"

        "body": "So, as of LABjs 2.0, older webkit (prior to about 2 months ago) will be the only browser that LABjs uses \"cache preloading\" on. There will be other forms of parallel/preloading in other/newer browsers, but they won't be based on preloading into the cache.\n\nAs such, the question for this feature request becomes, should I give a feature to disable caching (which will work in most browsers)? I'm inclined to see the value here, so maybe, yes. \n\nBut, what should the feature do in older webkit? If you have it turned on, should it turn off preloading (and go to serial loading) for those older browsers? Or should the cache-disabling be ignored in those older browsers? It's clear that cache-preloading would be totally incompatible with cache-busting, so this question needs to be resolved before I can land such a feature. Frankly, I'm not quite sure which way to go on it. Thoughts?\n"

        "body": "hmmmm... i see why you want this feature, but i'm not entirely convinced it should be baked into a script loader. seems like a fairly limited use case. The more common case seems to be to want a random cache-busting-everytime parameter added (like in dev). With implementing this feature as you've requested, I'd either have to implement both, or the (what i think is more common) use-case of always-cache-bust would require the user to do more \"work\" by calling `Math.random()` themselves (albeit only once, in the config setting).\n\nYour use case on the other hand, being (I think) less common, is easily solvable with a JS variable:\n\n```\nvar _ver = \"?_=20110515\";\n$LAB.script(src1+_ver).script(src2+_ver).wait(...).....;\n```\n\nYes, that's more work, but I'm inclined to believe that perhaps that's the way it should be, because a loader really shouldn't be doing (IMHO) semantic things to determine which resource URL you mean to load. LABjs is very strict and limited in what interpolation it does on a script URL... it only currently will do canonicalization (something browser already does, so LABjs just mimicks), but it won't do anything else to a script URL (even capitalization normalizations).\n\nThe suggested issue #27 is adding more on-the-fly modification of the source URL, but only in a completely clear use-case of disabling caching, not anything about specifically picking a particular script resource by query string.\n\nThis is a fine line subjective judgement call here, but I think LABjs should default to forcing the calling code to be explicit about which URL resource it wants loaded, rather than baking in features where LABjs automatically guesses. I could imagine someone asking for LABjs to automatically add the \".js\" extension, or automatically append other query string information like run-time variables (UA, etc) in the same vein, and I think those would ill-advised feature-creep for a script loader, so your request feels a tiny bit like the slippery slope toward that.\n\nI haven't made a final decision yet, just sharing my rationale at this point. Comments welcomed.\n"

        "body": "dynamic script loaders, by definition, unblock the script loading from affecting the page's initial processing/rendering (aka, they do not block DOM-ready). However, in most browsers, they do still block `window.onload`.\n\n`$L.block_rendering()` would be impossible to achieve, as the only way to do that would to either have a `&lt;script>` tag in the markup, or `document.write(..)` one, which wouldn't work if $LAB were being used dynamically to load scripts at a later time.\n\nI'm confused a bit by your code snippet. You're loading a file with LABjs called \"adscript.js\". Is this the file that has the `ad_server_function_uses_doc_write()` function defined in it? As it stands, you can't do it the way you've shown with LABjs, because the $L.script() call will be asynchronous, but your inline script block with that function call in it will execute immediately in the thread. You'd have to do something like:\n\n```\n$LAB.script(\"adscript.js\").wait(function(){ ad_server_function_uses_doc_write(); });\n```\n\nBut, since that script has (and requires) document.write(), it has to run in place, and is incompatible with being loaded/run by LABjs (or most script loaders, for that matter).\n\n```\n<script src=\"adscript.js\"></script>\n<script>ad_server_function_uses_doc_write();</script>\n```\n\n...is probably the best you can do, if `document.write()` is required.\n\n> Also, can i use LABjs as preloader? to download scripts and not execute them?\n\nThe browsers do not yet give us a consistent/non-hacky way to accomplish this. The only loaders which allow it are relying on ugly hacks like cache-preloading. I have not put in such a feature into LABjs because I don't think it's responsible to base functionality primarily on hacks, so I will wait to introduce such functionality until it's a directly supported feature in all current releases of the major browsers.\n\nThere's hope though, because IE _does_ support it directly (has since IE4), and the spec even suggests wording which makes an explicit preloading mechanism of that sort quite feasible. We just have to get other browsers to implement the suggestion (or get it turned into a requirement!). LABjs 2.0 includes future-thinking feature detection for this functionality, and in fact uses it for normal LABjs loading in all versions of IE (in replacement of cache-preloading for that browser use-case).\n\nMore info on explicit preloading proposals: http://wiki.whatwg.org/wiki/Script_Execution_Control\n"

        "body": "As near as I can tell from my brief looks into this, LABjs is not the cause. LABjs does nothing to delay the DOM-ready of the page (in fact, it acts to unhinge script requests from the DOM-ready). This is especially true of any browsers that are not FF3.5 and below. In FF 3.5 below, LABjs does \"patch\" the _page_ for the fact that a `document.readyState` is not present in that browser. Doing so is to assist something like jQuery in doing DOM-ready detection.\n\nBut since this code only affects FF 3.5 and below, it is almost certainly not the cause of what you're seeing. I would suggest constructing a test page without LABjs where you manually load scripts dynamically with `document.createElement(\"script\")` and see how the page behaves with respect to the images blocking DOM-ready.\n\nWhat I believe this will boil down to is probably quirks/bugs with the browser(s) that will need to be filed, not with there being something that LABjs is doing to create this side-effect.\n\nFYI: please make sure any bugs you are reporting now are with LABjs 2.0, as 1.2 is now the old-stable, and 2.0 is the new version (about to be fully released).\n"

        "body": "In your code snippet, the problem is that you're passing a function to `queueScript()`... passing functions to `script` or `queueScript` cause them to be executed immediately, so that the value they return is used as the src for which script to load. So your function is being run immediately, before jQuery has had a chance to run. This is by design.\n\nIf you want to queue up an inline block of code (that's what it appears from your block), and not have a function that is supposed to return a script URL, but instead have it wait for the appropriate sequence in the chain, then you want to pass that function to queueWait() instead. So, it would look like:\n\n```\n<script>\n$LAB.queueScript(\"/misc/jquery.js\");\n</script>\n<script>\n$LAB.queueWait(function() {x={};jQuery.extend(x, [test:1});});\n</script>\n```\n\nIn your example, there's no need for the empty `queueWait()` at the end of line 4 (though it doesn't really hurt anything being there or not).\n\nThe thing to remember is, $LAB chains work with `.script()` and `.wait()` calls... `.script()` calls specify URLs to load, whereas `.wait()` calls specify either/both where execution order needs to be preserved (as an `.wait()` call with no function passed to it), or where an inline script block needs to wait to run until that point in the chain. The queueing system is no different, except that the chain which you queue up isn't started/processed until you run `runQueue()`. But `queueScript()` corresponds to `script()` and `queueWait()` corresponds to `wait()`.\n\n---\n\nAs for your issue with scripts not running quickly enough... if you don't want queueing, which implies delaying the start of the processing of the queue until you call `runQueue()`, then simply use a regular `$LAB.script(..).wait(..)` type call, which will start loading right away. Your choice. But the purpose of the queue is so you can specify a chain ahead of time, but choose when you want to run that chain yourself. So you have that option if you use queuing.\n"

So, why don't load that script ahead?\n\nThe problem with $LAB.script().wait() is that it loads script right away, but also executes it. If there is only one chain, it's ok.

But for now, this is only possible in IE, and so the LABjs API does not expose such functionality.\n\nAt that point, we can revisit if it makes sense to pre-emptively preload scripts while in queueing.

It's not possible in current technology (without hacks). When it's possible with standardized tech, then I will put that type of feature into a future release of LABjs.\n\nSo, the only choice you have to make is, do I want script loading to start right away (use $LAB chains), or do I want script loading to start at some point slightly later, when I want, on-demand (use queueing).\n\nI don't understand why you want queueing to start loading right away? $LAB chains start loading right away. So use them instead.\n\nIt seems like you think there should be some way for queuing to load now, but not execute until `runQueue` is called. This is just not possible.\n"

But that's another problem. The one that I tries to make it work here is: change from\n\n```\n$LAB.script(\"http://drupal/test2.js\").script(\"http://drupal/test.js\");\n```\n\nto\n\n```\n$LAB.script(\"http://drupal/test2.js\").wait(function() {console.log('right after test2.js');}).script(\"http://drupal/test.js\");\n```\n\nThe code in wait() is executed after test.js, that's not what I want. In general, how to order scripts and inline blocks, in this case test.js depends on the inline block that does some initialization.\n\nThanks!\n"

        "body": "Not sure if this is the same issue, but i think it relates with the bug description. Basically i wrote a simple 'load.js' file responsible for managing the load chain for my needed libraries. My application needs jQuery >= 1.4.2 and jQuery UI **but** it must run as a guest widget inside a host page that could have loaded jQuery previously, so i can't make assumptions about what libraries are used by the host page.\nI've created a plain html page with jQuery 1.4.1 (simulating the potential conflict i could met) and jQuery UI. Also, I've added an inline just including my 'load.js' file, which is similar to this:\n\n``` javascript\n(function () {\n        var script = document.createElement(\"script\");\n        script.src = \"lib/LAB.js\";\n        script.onload = script.onreadystatechange = function () {\n            $LAB\n            .script(function(){\n                if ( (typeof jQuery === 'undefined') || (jQuery().jquery < '1.4.2') ) {\n                    console.log(\"loading jQuery 1.4.2...\");\n                    return \"http://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.4.2/jquery.min.js\";\n                }\n                else {\n                    console.log(\"jQuery >= 1.4.2 already loaded\");\n                    return null;\n                }       \n            }).wait(function(){console.log('wait for jQuery...');}) // wait for jQuery\n            .script(function(){\n                (function ($) {\n                    if ((typeof $.ui === 'undefined') || ($.ui.version < '1.7.2' )){\n                        console.log(\"loading jQuery UI with jQuery version \" + $().jquery);\n                        return \"http://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jqueryui/1.7.2/jquery-ui.js\";\n                    }else{\n                        console.log(\"jQuery UI already loaded with jQuery version \" + $().jquery);\n                        return null;\n                    }\n                })(jQuery.noConflict(true));\n            });\n        };\n        document.body.appendChild(script);\n})();\n```\n\nOn the other hand, this is the output from my console (both FF 5 and Chrome 12.0.742.124):\n\nload.js:12  loading jQuery 1.4.2...\nload.js:26  jQuery UI already loaded with jQuery version 1.4.1\nload.js:19  wait for jQuery...\n\nas you can see, the second 'script' call is executed before jQuery 1.4.2 is ready. Maybe I'm doing something wrong?\n"

        "body": "jpcarlino: what you are describing is not the same as the bug here, though I can see how it would seem that way from the small amount of info available in the description.\n\nIn your case, what you need to understand is that functions passed to `.script()` are all executed immediately (they don't \"wait\" like functions passed to `.wait()` do). The reason for this is that their primary purpose is to resolve (immediately) what scripts the chain should load, so that it can load in parallel.\n\nIn most cases, you can know what scripts you want to load all at once, and so LABjs can load them in parallel. In a few rare cases, you must wait to finish loading one script before you can know what the next script should be. In those cases, you should use a nested $LAB chain, instead of trying to load them all in one chain (because in that case, parallel is simply not possible -- chicken and the egg: how can you load a script now if you don't now know what the script URL is?)\n\nIn your case, you could approach it that way. But I think there's a 3rd option which I'd suggest, but you'll have to be very careful about some details. Consider:\n\n```\n(function () {\n   function load_my_scripts() {\n      var needs_jquery_142 = typeof jQuery === \"undefined\" || jQuery().jquery < \"1.4.2\";\n      var needs_jquery_ui_172 = needs_jquery_142 || typeof jQuery.ui === \"undefined\" || $.ui.version < \"1.7.2\";\n\n      var $ = (!needs_jquery_142) ? jQuery : null; // if we need to load jQuery 1.4.2, leave alias empty for now, otherwise set alias\n      var $ui = (!needs_jquery_ui_172) ? $.ui : null; // if we need to load jQuery-UI 1.7.2, leave alias empty for now, otherwise set alias\n\n      $LAB\n         .script(function(){\n            if (needs_jquery_142) {\n               console.log(\"loading jQuery 1.4.2\");\n               return \"http://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.4.2/jquery.min.js\";\n            }\n            else {\n               console.log(\"jQuery \" + jQuery().jquery + \" already loaded\");\n               return null; // no need to load anything\n            }       \n         })\n         .wait(function(){\n            if (needs_jquery_142) {\n               console.log(\"jQuery 1.4.2 now loaded\");\n            }\n            else {\n               console.log(\"using jQuery that was already loaded\");\n            }\n         })\n         .script(function(){\n            if (needs_jquery_ui_172) {\n               console.log(\"loading jQuery UI 1.7.2, with jQuery \" + (needs_jquery_142 ? \"1.4.2\" : jQuery().jquery));\n               return \"http://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jqueryui/1.7.2/jquery-ui.js\";\n            }\n            else{\n               console.log(\"jQuery UI \" + jQuery.ui.version + \" already loaded, with jQuery \" + (needs_jquery_142 ? \"1.4.2\" : jQuery().jquery));\n               return null; // no need to load anything\n            }\n        })\n        .wait(function(){\n           if (needs_jquery_ui_172) {\n              console.log(\"jQuery UI 1.7.2 now loaded\");\n              $ui = jQuery.ui; // now we can capture the alias for jQuery UI\n           }\n           else {\n              console.log(\"using jQuery UI that was already loaded\");\n           }\n           if (needs_jq_142) {\n              $ = jQuery.noConflict(true); // now we can capture the $ alias by calling `noConflict()`\n              $.ui = $ui; // restore jQuery UI alias lost in `noConflict()` call\n           }\n           console.log(\"jQuery >= 1.4.2 and jQuery UI >= 1.7.2 are ready\");\n        });\n   }\n\n   var LABjs_loaded = !(!$LAB);\n\n   if (LABjs_loaded) {\n      load_my_scripts();\n   }\n   else {\n      var script = document.createElement(\"script\");\n      script.src = \"lib/LAB.js\";\n      script.onload = script.onreadystatechange = function () {\n         if ((script.readyState && script.readyState != \"complete\" && script.readyState != \"loaded\") || LABjs_loaded) return;\n         script.onload = script.onreadystatechange = null;\n         LABjs_loaded = true;\n         load_my_scripts();\n      };\n      document.body.appendChild(script);\n   }\n})();\n```\n\nTry that out and see if that does what you want/expect.\n"

        "body": "Thank you very much for your response! I didn't expect such detailed answer :)\n\nAnyway, after a detailed reading and testing of your code, i'm not sure if the behaviour is exactly what i need. Or maybe is that i don't understand the second `script` call:\n\n``` javascript\nfunction() {\n    if (needs_jquery_ui_172) {\n        console.log(\"loading jQuery UI 1.7.2, with jQuery \" + \n                 (needs_jquery_142 ? \"1.4.2\" : jQuery().jquery));\n        return \"http://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jqueryui/1.7.2/jquery-ui.js\";\n    } else {\n        console.log(\"jQuery UI \" + jQuery.ui.version + \n                 \" already loaded, with jQuery \" + \n                 (needs_jquery_142 ? \"1.4.2\" : jQuery().jquery));\n        return null; // no need to load anything\n    }\n}\n```\n\nspecifically this statement:\n\n``` javascript\nconsole.log(\"loading jQuery UI 1.7.2, with jQuery \" + (needs_jquery_142 ? \"1.4.2\" : jQuery().jquery));\n```\n\nActually i don't see why jQuery UI 1.7.2 (we always refer to this example) is **said** to be loaded with jQuery 1.4.2. Yes, my component could need jQuery 1.4.2, so the corresponding boolean value is true, but now that i understood how `script` and `wait` methods work... what guarantees that the first step of the chain (responsible for loading jQuery 1.4.2) has actually ended? I mean, the second `script` call is running in paralell with the first one. Maybe jQuery UI file loads and executes first. So i don't see where is the mechanism that ensures that jQuery UI is loaded with the right jQuery library. And actually this is my biggest problem, because i would need to load a thrid library (the real component i have developed) **if and only if** I can use the right jQuery and jQuery UI versions.\n\nAgain, please excuse me if I'm asking something trivial :)\n"

So, if jquery 1.4.2 is present, but jquery-ui 1.7.2 is not, then the first `.script()` call is basically a no-op (doesn't load anything), except that it prints to the console what's happening. If both are present, then both `.script()` calls are no-op's. If neither are present, then both `.script()` calls request their respective resources.\n\nThe `console.log()` statement that you reference means \"I am now loading jquery-ui 1.7.2, and i'm loading it on top of jquery x.x.x\", where \"x.x.x\" is either \"1.4.2\", since we requested to load that version, or it's whatever version of the jquery that's already present, which we know will be >= 1.4.2.\n\nAs for your question: how do I know if jquery-ui will run after jquery, and thus load on top of it? because that's how LABjs works... if you have a `$LAB.script(\"a\").wait(...).script(\"b\")` chain, then LABjs always ensures that \"a\" runs before \"b\". In your case, we're also combining in conditional logic, which says that \"a\" doesn't need to run if the \"a\" is already present on the page. \n\nBut either way, we're sure that \"a\" is present (in this case, jquery >= 1.4.2) before \"b\" (jquery-ui 1.7.2) runs. Furthermore, we're sure that if both \"a\" and \"b\" are already present in the page, and no loading is necessary, then the chain's final `.wait()` call will run after \"a\" and \"b\" are both satisified (either loaded and executed, or detected to already be present).\n"

I make the assumption in my code snippet above that the case of \"jquery already present, but < 1.4.2\" and \"jquery-ui already present, but >= 1.7.2\" is either not possible, or if it happens, then it's still best to load both to be safe. In other words, there's not logic in there to load only jquery but not jquery-ui... if you have to load jquery, then you will have to load jquery-ui.\n\nThat logic is essentially enforced here:\n\n```\nvar needs_jquery_142 = ...\nvar needs_jquery_ui_172 = needs_jquery_142 || ...\n```\n\nSo, we determine that we need jquery-ui to load IF:\n- jquery is being loaded; OR\n- jquery-ui is missing; OR\n- jquery-ui is present, but a lower version\n"

        "body": "Fine. Thank you for your answer.\n\nWell, my question was based then on a second misunderstanding of how `script` and `wait` works, after your first answer:\n\n> functions passed to .script() are all executed immediately (they don't \"wait\" like functions passed to .wait() do). The reason for this is that their primary purpose is to resolve (immediately) what scripts the chain should load, so that it can load in parallel.\n\nbut now you say in your last comment:\n\n> if you have a $LAB.script(\"a\").wait(...).script(\"b\") chain, then LABjs always ensures that \"a\" runs before \"b\". In your case, we're also combining in conditional logic, which says that \"a\" doesn't need to run if the \"a\" is already present on the page. \n\nI think this missconception was produced by the difference between `.script(function)` and `.wait(function)` semantics. In the first case the function is called immediately to determine _what_ to load (conditional). In the second case, the function is intended to execute business logic _ensuring_ the scripts above were all loaded.\n\nThank you!\n"

        "body": "I'm experiencing a strange behaviour when i test your loading scheme on FF 3.6.18 (Ubuntu 10.10). It works excellent on FF 5.0. I think it relates with the fact that my component library has a main `$(callback)` function, which means it should be executed when DOM is ready.\n\nTo simplify, assume my main librarary file (`component.js`) has the following content:\n\n``` javascript\n$(function() {\n    console.log(\"using jQuery version: \" + $().jquery);\n}\n```\n\non the other hand, i'm using your suggested load chain, except i've added my `component.js` file at last place:\n\n``` javascript\n    // .....\n    .script(\"component.js\")\n    .wait(function(){\n        console(\"component.js loaded ...\");\n        // ... trigger a startup event to start my component\n    });\n\n```\n\non FF 3.6.18, the first time (i mean, before it is cached by the browser for subsequent requests) LAB loads the `component.js` file everything works as expected, which means: the aforementioned message says jQuery version is 1.4.2 (the library version i'm loading specifically for this component) **and** the console.log message on the last `wait()` is printed last before the component is started. But on subsequent attempts the 'on document ready' callback inside `component.js` is invoked before the `wait()` function, it breaks (because jQuery version is lower) and the `console.log` on the last `wait()` is never shown. In case `console.log` is asynchronous i have tried replacing it with an `alert()`, which of course is never shown.\n\nDo you know if this could be a bug on the library when executed on older FF versions and the library has an 'on document ready' callback?\n"

        "body": "v2.0 includes two API functions for managing multiple LABjs instances. Unfortunately, neither of those were present in LAB 1.x, so if you happen to load 1.x onto a page over the top of a 2.x+ instance, it will pave over it mercilessly without recourse. :(\n\nBut, if you load 2.x+ on top of an existing LAB instance, you can call `noConflict()` on the most recent one, which will roll back LABjs to the previous one (the one it was when it loaded) and return you the new instance in case you want it. This works basically quite the same as jQuery's `noConflict()`, so I felt that was such a good pattern I just mirrored it.\n\nYou can also use the `sandbox()` API function on an existing copy of LABjs, which creates a new instance of LABjs that is not tied to the global `window.$LAB`. Whereas `noConflict()` is a reactive method that you call once a new LABjs has been loaded onto a page, `sandbox()` is a proactive method that you call defensively, when you first load LABjs. Basically what it does is give you a separate copy of LABjs from the global copy, which means all your internal state will be kept safe in that copy, as long as you keep a reference to that copy around.\n\nEither or both of those methods may be something that can help with your situation. BUT, I think it's possible there's a simpler approach that doesn't need either one.\n\nIf you simply capture a reference to the global `window.$LAB` before using it, and then everywhere that you use LABjs, always use that captured reference instead of relying on the global, then you will be sure to always keep your own copy of LABjs. When/if a second copy of LABjs is loaded and overwrites the global one, you still have reference to the copy, which means your copy will continue to function as you expect. The key is to make sure that you always reference $LAB using your reference, instead of the global reference.\n\nThat might look like this:\n\n```\n<script src=\"LAB.js\"></script>\n<script>\n(function($L){\n    // all my code inside here now uses $L instead of $LAB or window.$LAB\n    // so I'm safe if someone overwrites the main window.$LAB instance\n})($LAB);\n```\n\nLemme know if any of that helps address your issues.\n"

Your solutions all make sense, but isn't quite what I want for my particular case.\n\nOur application is set up to allow pages to either be loaded as a normal web page, or as a dialog within another page. In the case of a normal page load, we want to load LAB.js and load scripts normally. In the case of a dialog within another page, we want LAB to load only the scripts the new page references that aren't already loaded, which AllowDuplicates=false already handles very well.\n\nIt's true that we could test for the existence of the $LAB variable, and document.write a script tag to load it if it didn't exist to also solve the problem. But, it would just be simpler for us if the library handled the \"don't load myself twice on a page\" part of it. If it's not a change you want introduced into lab, I understand and we'll work around it another way.\n\nThanks,\n\nChris\n"

        "body": "The \"don't load LABjs twice\" part is actually contrary to the use-case that caused me to add `noConflict()` and `sandbox()`. I had many people with use-cases around needing to maintain separate copies of LABjs. So, I'm not quite sure how I could cleanly serve both the use-cases: \"do allow LABjs to gracefully load multiple times' and \"don't allow LABjs to load multiple times\".\n\nIn my original interpretation of your question, it seemed like you were in a non-trusting, non-cooperative scenario. By that, I mean, it seemed like you were in a case where some page or code you don't control might come along and load a LABjs instance over the top of yours without your consent. In response to that, the above 3 solutions I talked about are ways for you to protect yourself from such a case. And in that vein, you would actually want for that other code to not use the same copy of LABjs as you were using, because you'd want for the two to not be able to interfere with each other.\n\nConsider for example the case where your self-contained widget might get loaded into a \"hostile\" (that is, not one you know or control) page. That page may or may not use LABjs itself. But your widget should be able to use its own private copy of LABjs, regardless of what the page does or does not do with respect to LABjs. That's why `noConflict()` and `sandbox()` are useful, to allow silo'd copies of LABjs to work independently of each other.\n\nOn the flip side, if you're loading into an environment where there is explicit trust and control, and you can have the environments cooperate, then you don't need those defensive tactics at all. In that case, you want them to \"cooperate\" on their shared copy of LABjs, so as to take advantage of `AllowDuplicates`, etc.\n\nTo rephrase the cooperation issue... you need to have all pieces of your code that need LABjs to do a \"conditional load\" of LABjs... that is, each piece of code that uses LABjs needs to check and see if LAB is already loaded, and only load it if it's needed. That way, whichever piece of code runs first on a page, LABjs will be loaded, and all other pieces that run later will simply skip over loading LABjs.\n\nThis type of cooperative conditional loading is generally quite easy. And it DOES NOT require `document.write()`. :)\n\nTo conditionally load LABjs, all you have to do is this:\n\n```\nfunction LABjs_is_ready() {\n   // put your code to use LABjs here\n}\n\nif (!$LAB) {\n   var scriptElem = document.createElement(\"script\"), scriptdone = false;\n   scriptElem.onload = scriptElem.onreadystatechange = function () {\n      if ((scriptElem.readyState && scriptElem.readyState !== \"complete\" && scriptElem.readyState !== \"loaded\") || scriptdone) return false;\n      scriptElem.onload = scriptElem.onreadystatechange = null;\n      scriptdone = true;\n      LABjs_is_ready();\n   };\n   scriptElem.src = \"/path/to/LAB.js\";\n   document.head.insertBefore(scriptElem, document.head.firstChild);\n}\nelse LABjs_is_ready();\n```\n\nAll you need to do is make sure that any page or code which loads LABjs does so conditionally, like this, and your cooperation should be fine to make sure that `AllowDuplicates` functionality works for different consumers of the $LAB api.\n"

We should be able to build a solution which uses that idea.\n\nTo address \"So, I'm not quite sure how I could cleanly serve both the use-cases: 'do allow LABjs to gracefully load multiple times' and 'don't allow LABjs to load multiple times'.\"\n\nIsn't the answer to this straightforward? To get a new instance of lab, you call $LAB.sandbox(). Manually loading LAB.js twice on one page would not overwrite the $LAB global. As I mentioned in my first post, you can have the first instance of LAB loaded on the page include some special value that it checks for to determine if the current $LAB variable is the same script.\n\nSo, you could set an instance variable \"detect\" within LAB to a special value, like \"oshdf893y23\". Then, when LAB loads, you can check if there's already a $LAB variable with that detect value, and if so, don't do anything. If that value doesn't exist, you continue loading like normal.\n\nI think that solves both cases of getting a new copy of lab when you need it, and not getting one accidentally when you don't.\n\nI appreciate your time considering this problem.\n\nChris\n"

Manually loading LAB.js twice on one page would \n> not overwrite the $LAB global.\n\nBut there's a strong precedent in javascript libraries (jQuery, for instance) to overwrite when loaded again, and to allow rolling back with `noConflict()`. I have to believe there's a reason that most every other script out there doesn't do what you're suggesting.\n\nSpeaking of `noConflict()`, seems like it could solve quite trivially your issue, now that I think about it. Consider:\n\n```\n<script src=\"LAB.js\"></script>\n<script>\n(function(){\n   var $L = $LAB.noConflict();\n   if (!window.$LAB) window.$LAB = $L; // $LAB was rolled back too far, so restore it!\n})();\n</script>\n```\n\nIn that way, you ask to load LABjs every time, and you always roll it back with `noConflict()`, and only if you've rolled it back too far (that is, there's no $LAB anymore), then you re-assign the global. Now, in all your code, always use the global $LAB, and you should be fine. This makes sure there's only ever one instance of $LAB running on a page.\n"

        "body": "What you are asking for makes sense, and is a common request, however it's not possible (short of hacks) in today's browsers, because we don't have a way to load a script but tell it not to execute until we ask it to. That would be required in your pattern, to get \"bar.js\" to load, but not execute, and then we get to choose when bar.js executes. This is not possible without preloading, and preloading (currently) requires hacks (which LABjs now disavows). Preloading will eventually come to browsers, and when it does, this will be easy.\n\nThere are three options for you:\n1. use a loader that uses hacks (Steal being one such example)\n2. wrap all your files in function declarations, that way the file itself can execute in any order, but you get to choose when the payload is executed, by calling and executing the wrapper function at the appropriate time. This is basically like the AMD module format that RequireJS and others use. But you can come up with your format and call your own functions, instead of having to use AMD and RequireJS.\n3. You can load files serially (loss of performance) if there's dependencies... it gets a little messy, but basically you put into each file a \"trigger\" that tells the framework to load the next file when the file in question is done with all its dependencies. \n\nFor instance:\n\n```\nvar q = [\"foo.js\", \"bar.js\", \"baz.js\", ...], q_idx = 0, pause;\nfunction next_in_queue() {\n   pause = false;\n   if (q_idx < q.length) $LAB.script(q[q_idx++]).wait(function(){\n      if (!pause) next_in_queue();\n   });\n}\nnext_in_queue();\n```\n\nAnd then, in each file, like foo.js, you either do (if the file has dependencies) this to pause the global queue while you load some dependencies:\n\n```\npause = true;\n$LAB.script(\"foo_dependency.js\").wait(next_in_queue);\n```\n\nOr you leave the file with nothing extra added (meaning no dependencies, and thus no need to pause), in which case the global queue will automatically continue immediately after the script in question finishes running.\n\nDon't get me wrong, option 3 is messy and sub-optimal. BUT, it's not as bad as the hacks that people are currently using to simulate \"preloading\" (which is what we really need).\n"

        "body": "Just thought of a different approach to option 3, which will allow you have any level deep of dependencies. \n\n```\n(function(){\n   var q = [], q_idx = 0;\n   window.next_in_queue = function() {\n      if (q_idx < q.length) $LAB.script(q[q_idx++]).wait(next_in_queue);\n   };\n   window.load_scripts = function(scripts) {\n      var splice_args = [].slice.call(scripts); // copy the passed in array of scripts\n      splice_args.unshift(q_idx,0); // put the first two arguments to `splice()` onto the front of the array\n      [].splice.apply(q, splice_args); // send the arguments to `splice()`\n   };\n})();\n\nload_scripts([\"foo.js\",\"bar.js\",\"baz.js\"]);\nnext_in_queue();\n```\n\nAnd then, inside a file with dependencies, you just call the helper method, like in foo.js:\n\n```\nload_scripts([\"foo_dependency_1.js\", \"foo_dependency_2.js\", ...]);\n```\n\nThat's it for additions to the file (no need for the global variable `pause` as I showed in the previous comment). You will basically have inserted these files you just specified into the global queue at the appropriate index location, and then when this current script finishes, and `next_in_queue()` is called, it will start loading those files, again in order, and again allowing them to subsequently inject their own new scripts into the queue as needed.\n\nNow, again, you'll be losing all benefits to parallel loading with this approach, because everything will load serially. But, it sounded like nested dependency annotation (and the code maintenance benefits thereof) is more important to you than performance. So, if that's true, I recommend this option 3 approach.\n"

At first glance, what seems strange to me is that I'd put into the API a feature (setting `.text`) which works in some cases, and not in others. Specifically, if you are in an older webkit browser, and loading a local script, the method used (by default), is XHR, with script injection by setting the `.text` property on a script element. In that case, what should we then do if you've also set the `.text` property via the options? It'd be a possible race condition to set it first to the actual loaded code via XHR, and then afterwards set it to the option value passed in.\n\nNot sure about this one. Thoughts?\n"

        "body": "> Another option would be for LABjs to disable loading via XHR if there is a .text specified for the script. (I.e. if there is a .text, treat local scripts as non-local.)\n\nFirstly, I think this violates the principle of least-surprise. People who are expecting XHR loading won't understand this bizarre round-about reason why XHR is disabled if they set the `text` property. Even with good documentation, that smells like a WTF. Now, granted, it's a very small niche audience that's ever gonna do this, but still.\n\nMore importantly, however, there's a reason why this type of functionality is simply not compatible with XHR loading+script injection. The functionality you describe relies on being able to scan the document to find a script element that has a `src` property that matches the expected URL. With XHR+script inject, a script element is indeed created, but its `src` property is not set (because we already have the code loaded, don't want to load it again). So, in the case of XHR+script injection, even if you did figure out a way to set the `text` property simultaneously, the code would never find that script element.\n\nYou can't really reliably create a script element, set its `src` attribute/property, but not have the browser start fetching it. So, I see no way to make a script that needs `text` setting functionality as you descibe compatible with XHR.\n\nSo we've thoroughly established that XHR and `text` setting simply cannot co-exist. \n\nBut the other problem with your idea (disabling XHR) is that it would force LABjs to use the ugliest of all the hacks: \"cache preloading\". \"Cache preloading\" is not only brittle, but it fails completely for scripts which are sent out with improper (or missing) caching headers. Recent studies have suggested that as much as 50% of scripts on the web are served in such a non-caching fashion.\n"

Normally the plusone code adds that itself (if it is not there), but calling `render` from the script body prevents it from doing so for reasons that I only partially understand.\n\nAnyhow, that works!   Thank you!\n\n> Also, found this:\n> http://googlewebmastercentral.blogspot.com/2011/07/1-button-now-faster.html\n> \n> I don't see in there where they suggest how you do the \"config\" settings. But surely there's some way to do so that works with their async code.\n\n(You can set the inner text of the script element `po.text=\"{'parsetags':'explicit'}\"'.)\n\n> IF you can figure out how to set the config without using the inner text (which it seems there must be a way, since their async snippet doesn't set it), then you can load g+1 with LABjs, but set the config however they support it, thus not needing the text setting in the first place.\n\nI haven't been able to figure that out yet.  [Google says](http://code.google.com/apis/+1button/#async-load) that you should be able to set `window.___gcfg`.  For setting `lang` (as per their example) it works, but for setting `parsetags` (which is what I care about) it does not seem to work for me. :-/\n"

        "body": "> Firstly, I think this violates the principle of least-surprise. People who are expecting XHR loading won't understand this bizarre round-about reason why XHR is disabled if they set the text property. Even with good documentation, that smells like a WTF. Now, granted, it's a very small niche audience that's ever gonna do this, but still.\n\nMy (clearly flawed) understanding was that XHR was pretty much an implementation detail, used (only for local scripts) because (for reasons I hadn't completely grokked, but am now starting to) it is more efficient. I.e. one tells LABjs what script to load and LABjs loads it in the most appropriate manner.  E.g. if the script is not local, XHR is not used because XHR won't work in that case.   I was thinking that the script body case was analogous if one specifies a script body, then XHR should be disabled, since it won't work in that case.\n\n> You can't really reliably create a script element, set its src attribute/property, but not have the browser start fetching it. So, I see no way to make a script that needs text setting functionality as you descibe compatible with XHR.\n\nMostly out of curiosity, does the hack used [here](http://bezen.org/javascript/src/bezen.domwrite.js) (in `appendScriptClone`) work reliably?  (Set the scripts `type` to `\"any\"` before adding it to the DOM tree, then update the `type` after inserting the new element.)\n\n> But the other problem with your idea (disabling XHR) is that it would force LABjs to use the ugliest of all the hacks: \"cache preloading\".\n\nYeah, I was figuring that in this case (non-empty script body) would be rare enough that this wouldn't be a big issue. And besides, I was thinking this would mostly come up for loading external scripts, in which case XHR is not really an option in the first place, right?\n"

        "body": "What you're describing is in fact by design, but I can see how it's a bit confusing. There's a subtle difference between the type of chain where you call the queue methods (global) and the type of chain with setOptions() and script() and wait(), which is actually a loading-specific chain. The global queue methods are just that -- global...which means the chaining is sorta convenience only. The loading specific chains have internal state that is saved and is local only to that chain, which is critically reliant on the chaining.\n\nTo keep those two subtle-but-important functionalities separate and not confused, I specifically return a diff object for each chain type. To set options for global loading (the queues), use the setGlobalDefaults(), and for per-chain options, use setOptions(). Think of it this way...the global queue sets up what _will_ become a single local chain, but it doesn't become that type of chain until you call runQueue().\n\nSorry for that subtle confusion. I'll think about how I can clarify this topic in the docs.\n"

        "body": "(sorry for my delay in getting to responding to this thread)\n\n@scriby is correct in the design reasons of the queueing system as it applies to this question.\n\nFurthermore:\n1. DOMready and all-scripts-loaded are two distinct events/concepts, which prior to script loaders were unfortunately conflated to be one-in-the-same. This should not be. DOMready is for code that needs to interact with the DOM, and all-scripts-loaded is for, not surprisingly, when all scripts finish loading. Don't use one for the other's intended use. You're asking for problems if you do. If you need to wait for both, then compose both events by a variety of methods, by essentially listening for both events, and once they've both fired, then running some code.\n2. LABjs specifically does not do any DOM-ready detection, nor does it intend to. There is a hack in there right now to help jQuery do DOM-ready detection in older Firefox (<= 3.5), but that code is deprecated and being removed soon. In any case, LABjs has no capability to know when the DOM is or is not ready in a cross-browser way. That's a whole set of hacks that other frameworks (like jQuery) already tackle. If you want/need DOM-ready detection, use a lib/framework that does it (and load that framework with LABjs!). I do this on all my sites, with jQuery.\n3. Now, could LABjs do a \"all-scripts-are-done-loading\" type of event notification? Possibly. But it's uglier than you think it would be. As @scriby indicated, the free-form (and resumable chain) nature of LABjs is that you never really know that all scripts have been requested yet. So, the best LABjs could do is to fire that event every time all the current scripts are finished loading, but that means it would be more complicated for people because that event might fire many times. Rather than address that complicated use-case, I implemented queuing in part to give you explicit (I'm done requesting a set of scripts, and go ahead and load them).\n\nI just haven't seen enough evidence that this use-case is worth the ugliness/confusion such a feature would entail. Closing for now. Will revisit later if more evidence is surfaced to sway the discussion.\n"

Unfortunately, when you break it down, it doesn't make as much sense as it seems at first.\n\nAs of current generation browsers, only IE (and older webkit) will fetch external files into a &lt;script> tag if the type is an \"unrecognized script type\" such as \"text/html\". Moreover, even in IE, if you fetch a fake mime-type resource externally, you can't access its contents (especially cross-domain).\n\nAFAIK, jQuery templates require you to embed the template into an inline script element, or load it via XHR and manually inject it.\n\nSince LABjs isn't really concerned much with the creation of inline script elements, once you examine it from that angle, this feature becomes a lot less useful for LABjs to implement.\n\nThe only other possible approach (forcing loading/injecting with XHR) is something I've considered, but since it only works same domain (or cross-domain if CORS is in place), it's a tenuous feature to add because it will tend, in the general case, to lead to failure behavior for people unless they know what they're doing. So I haven't added such a feature yet. But it's open for discussion still, if it can be demonstrated that the benefits outweigh those negatives.\n"

        "body": "In earlier versions of LABjs (pre 2.x), the trailing .wait() was necessary to avoid a subtle race condition. The rewrite of LABjs removed that quirk, however, as of 2.0.\n\nAs it stands now, there is no reason at all to add an empty .wait() onto the end of a chain. It doesn't hurt anything, but it's kinda like a trailing comma... you might leave it there because it might make it easier to append to your chain later if you want to.\n\nIt's important to remember that a single $LAB.script().script().wait().script()... chain is completely independent. So ending it with a .wait() doesn't imply anything about affecting any other behavior in any other chain... behavior is completely localized only to that chain.\n\nWhat you suggest, about .wait() somehow affecting the execution of the surrounding code, is impossible to do in JavaScript (no code pre-emption), except with firefox's experimental `yield` statement. So, I can understand semantically why you would expect that, but it's not at all what .wait() does. It's only for controlling execution flow within the chain in question.\n"

Any idea why this would be ? i.e. basically if I refresh the page it works no problem, but as soon as go back or forward then I get JS errors from LAB like\n\n`Uncaught TypeError: Object [object Object] has no method 'imagesLoaded'`\n\nI have defined some scripts on my `Master.Page` like\n\n`var commonLoad = \n$LAB\n.script('script1.js').wait();\n.script('script2.js').wait();\n.script('script3.js');`\n\nThen I use on the page Im working on\n\n`commonLoad\n.script('relies-on-commonLoad.js').wait()\n.wait(function() {\n//some code\n});`\n\nHowever, when I use the back and forward buttons - I get errors ? All I am doing is loading code via `jQuery()` which applies to the page images ? Is this something related to caching maybe or the DOM not being ready or ?\n\nCan't understand why ?\n\n[p.s - why oh why can't Github move \"Comment & Close\" to `float:left` ??? or near \"Close Issue\" :P]\n"

I was essentially going to suggest you post it here anyway. :)\n\n---\n\nI just tried your test page in FF7 (windows), and with a bunch of refreshes (empty and full cache), and it always outputs this to the console:\n\nstart script load (ordered async): http://rewind.sgconsulting.it/test-lab/../js/mustache-min.js\nstart script load (ordered async): http://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.6.4/jquery.min.js\nstart script load (ordered async): http://rewind.sgconsulting.it/test-lab/../js/jquery.lightbox-0.5.min.js\nstart script load (ordered async): http://rewind.sgconsulting.it/test-lab/../js/s3slider.js\nscript execution finished: http://rewind.sgconsulting.it/test-lab/../js/mustache-min.js\nscript execution finished: http://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.6.4/jquery.min.js\nscript execution finished: http://rewind.sgconsulting.it/test-lab/../js/jquery.lightbox-0.5.min.js\nscript execution finished: http://rewind.sgconsulting.it/test-lab/../js/s3slider.js\n\nThat is exactly the output I would expect given the $LAB chain you're running, and it shows that jQuery executes at the proper sequence.\n\nSeeing your image, I'm really confused, because I can't see how it's possible for that to happen. It would seem that it's perhaps some bug in Firefox on that particular platform, because since FF4, \"ordered async\" has been there to ensure the order of scripts is the same as that requested. In the case of \"ordered async\", LABjs essentially doesn't do anything special at all, except request the scripts, and rely on the browser to do all the work. So, the browser appears to be doing something wrong here.\n\nWhich platform are you running on? It looks like linux?\n\nFirst thing we need to do is eliminate LABjs as the issue. I've created this little snippet of code for you to run (instead of LABjs) to see how it behaves. Can you try it?\n\nhttps://gist.github.com/1287385\n\nThat code snippet basically represents all that LABjs is doing internally in your particular scenario. By spec, it should always ensure the execution order. If we can observe it failing to do so, then it's clearly a bug in Firefox.\n"

You're not forcing that older element to be \"released\" from cache. You're simply telling your UI to request an entirely new file, which means that theoretically both files are now in cache. That's not cache-busting, in the proper sense of the term.\n\nIn fact, even the actual \"CacheBust\" feature in LABjs is probably a little misnamed, in that it doesn't really prevent (bust) caching. What it does though, in contrast to your requested feature, is to ensure that we **NEVER** use a cached version of the file (because every request is a new uncached version). So in that sense, I'm ok with calling it \"cache busting\", because it's actually \"cache ignoring\".\n\nBut in your sense, I don't think it's correct to call that \"cache busting\". If anything, it's \"cache versioning\" or \"cache conditioning\" or \"cache layering\" or something like that.\n\nAnyway, this is probably just going to deteriorate into some bikeshedding about what to call it., which frankly doesn't matter _that_ much.\n\nThe real question is whether the concerns I raised about encouraging \"bad practice\" are overcome by the usefulness (as was the case with BasePath, CacheBust, and relative-protocols)? I don't see that argument being made... yet.\n"

        "body": "After further thought, I can see how it's ok to call both the random number and the key as \"cache busting\". That's not how I originally thought about it, but it seems to be the more conventional (if not entirely accurate) way to describe what's going on. So, let's set aside the bikeshed of what to call it, and get back to the issue at hand. \n\nSome questions I'd like you to ponder and provide any insight you might have:\n1. There's clear precedent for \"best practice\" being that versioning should be in the file name (like CDN's require), not in the query string. This feature, as requested/implemented, breaks that best practice, and encourages a less robust pattern. Should such a \"less-good practice\" be built into the core of LABjs?\n2. Won't this eventually lead to people wanting LABjs to have an option put the `CacheBustKey` into the filename instead of into the query string, so that _they_ can follow best-practice? Won't that request be simultaneously logical/reasonable, but also much more complicated (do we use . or - separators, etc)?\n3. What if you don't want **all** your files to have the `CacheBustKey` (maybe most of them need it, but a few files you load from third-parties, and you certainly don't want them to have it). How would the API cleanly handle only applying it to some?\n4. If we start allowing some semantic behavior for rewriting/rearranging the file names of `script()` requests, won't that be a slippery slope where we end up with more intrusive behavior like people wanting to leave off the \".js\" and have it added automatically, or people wanting the automatic path calculation by specifying package names, etc. Where do we draw the line?\n"

You would be better off just wrapping every JS file in a big try/catch, if the \"sledge hammer, meet tiny nail\" approach is what you're going after.\n\nWhy not focus on proper code techniques for robust error handling, rather than haphazardly letting errors bubble up?\n\nMoreover, the problem is I can't just let an error happen, or it will break LAB's internal functionality (possibly putting it in an indeterminate state) and stop the rest of the chain from executing. LABjs has to swallow the errors to prevent them from interferring with itself. The problem with not doing so is that people will tend to blame LABjs (since the dev tools will often \"lie\" and say that the error occurred in LABjs code).\n\nBy contrast, swallowing the errors and then letting a debug mode let you see those errors if you want to is far more graceful, especially when production environments are considered. I have found that most people would rather have graceful \"most of the code\" load and run, rather than \"fail hard and early\".\n"

Not all browsers are smart enough to allow re-throwing an error and have it preserve the original context, so in many cases, your dev tools end up identifying the `throw` line as the offending error line, not the original line that was `catch`d. Moreover, if you wrap the error handling in a `setTimeout`, now you further exacerbate debugging problems because you eliminate the call-stack from what the dev-tools can report.\n\nOverall, I think it's a very bad idea to try and re-throw an error, and even worse to do so in a delayed fashion as you suggest.\n\nI'd be better off literally calling `window.onerror` manually and passing in the error object myself, because at least the call-stack would be preserved (although muddied).\n"

These are things that I think represent a greater surprise to most developers (especially the less adept technical audience) than is \"hey, if you wanna see what is going on under the covers, use 'Debug' mode\".\n\nI want the default behavior of LABjs to be that it does as much as it can, not that it gives up (because JS gives up) at first error.\n\n---\n\nThe technical consequences of LABjs bailing on its part early are, I think, MUCH harder to find and debug, and much more likely to be blamed on LABjs. The problem is that we can't \"fully abort\" when an error happens, we can only partially abort at best. This leads to crazy to diagnose errors almost instantaneously.\n\nFor instance, imagine you have 5 scripts you're loading, and for each one, you have a `.wait(..)` callback to run after that script runs. Now, let's say that a script error occurs in the first of those callbacks. What will the behavior be if LABjs doesn't try to robustly handle that case? All 5 scripts themselves will run, in order, because that part is handled by the browser, but the 4 subsequent callbacks will NOT fire, because LABjs was aborted (by the JS engine) with the first error.\n\nWhat will happen? Probably LOTS of errors will bubble up, from all of your scripts. And most of them will be WTF red herrings that lead you down the wrong path, because it won't be at all obvious that LABjs only ran 1 of the 5 callbacks, even though all 5 scripts themselves ran.\n\nWhat's the more sane behavior by default? To keep running what callbacks we can, so that the only errors which occur are those DIRECTLY related to the actual problem, and not artifacts of weird internal implementation details of LABjs and how browsers behave.\n\nFewer errors, even if you have to go looking for them in debug output, are easier to solve than more errors. That's why the default behavior is as it stands.\n"

In neither case will you just happen to find errors that you didn't know about.\n\nThis feature request makes it slightly more direct and graceful to detect them, and perhaps provide you an opportunity to \"recover\", but you would still have had to read the documentation thoroughly to even understand the implications of why such a thing would be necessary.

I'm willing to agree to the sense in that argument.\n\nI'm not sure if that would have helped in your case? I provide a debug version of LABjs, with this debug mode functionality in it, because I hope that most people will use it by default, in their dev environment. By contrast, I hope that people DON'T use that build in production, at least not by regular practice, because they're not only using a larger version of the code unnecessarily, but I also think it's bad practice to \"leak\" implementation data to the console in production environments.\n\nIn this scenario, I would have suggested, were I consulted, to first switch to using debug mode, and see what LABjs says. If you see errors, fix them. If not, you've eliminated anything that LABjs is doing from the equation.\n\nBut we're back to a fundamental assumption from earlier in this thread: you have to have good practice, and know about the tools you're using, before you'll see what you hoped you would see.\n"

        "body": "Thanks for the response.  I added the following which works great for my purposes.  All that I really care about is whether an error occurred.  I'd prefer if execution halts at that point but from what you say that's not guaranteed depending on what browser you're working with.  I wouldn't see this as a way of actually \"handling\" errors in order to keep the app in a known state - if this fires I'd assume everything is fubar, but at least I can log it or during development just visually see there was a problem. A try/catch that swallows the error seems dangerous to me and makes it a lot tougher during development.\n\nI'd be interested to know if you think this changes LAB.js functionality in a negative way?  From what I can see it has no impact on anything unless you implement the ErrorHandler function.\n\nhttps://github.com/jasonhinkle/LABjs/blob/master/LAB.src.js  (relevant line 346)\n\nIn my application code I put the following:\n\n``` javascript\n$LAB.setGlobalDefaults({'ErrorHandler': function(err){\n    throw err;\n}});\n```\n\nObviously this is a drastic example of a handler, but for development on Chrome it's exactly what I want.  Are you saying that on other browsers this would not work at all - never get fired?  Or are you just worried that people will use something like this to try to recover from errors - when that is not reliable due to browser differences..?  Or that they will use it and it'll result in a bunch of false error reports for LABjs?\n"

However, all browsers have somewhat different behavior on which loading errors they fire for or not.

Then you didn't get any indication by LABjs that a problem occured with your chain.\n\nSo, you almost certainly have to do both kinds of errors.\n\nDo we combine them into one event, or do we publish two events (loadError, runtimeError)?

        "body": "I appreciate the pull request. I have not ruled out the possibility of adding an error handler functionality into LABjs, I've just been unhappy with the inconsistency it will invariably introduce.\n\nThe functionality you're providing in this patch is for calling an error handler whenever an error is trapped in a `wait()` callback. This (as I said in the other threads) is half of the \"error handling\" that most people expect from a script loader. My concern with this patch is that it implies that it's an overall error handler, when in fact it's only for the `wait()`'s. So, I might be inclined to have an error handler named `waitErrCallback` or something like that, so it was clear what its limited purpose is.\n\nI also am not sure this functionality belongs in the production (non-Debug) build/mode of LABjs. Right now, errors are only reported to the error console if you're using the debug build and have debug mode turned on (a previous suggestion I plan to implement will default debug mode on for debug build usage). While the relative file sizes aren't terribly different, the extra 200-400 bytes (minified) of code for debug mode is, I think, waste in the production builds.\n\nSo I may be inclined to add in the `waitErrCallback` functionality under the debug-mode plumbing.\n\nThis fits better with my philosophy that by default, production code should not be about reporting or exposing errors, it should be gracefully and silently handling them. If you need to troubleshoot a specific production problem, I think the better approach is to switch to using the debug build in production (thereby being able to catch errors however you wish), and then switch back to the production build when debugging is done. Philosophically, my opinion is that the default should not be to ship production code with debug-mode bits in it.\n\nOf course, an individual person could decide to always ship the debug mode to their production environment. That's fine for a case-by-case basis decision, but what this repo provides to the masses, I think should default to the more conservative approach.\n\nJust some thoughts. Thanks for the patch. It's under active consideration.\n"

        "body": "Thanks for the though-out reply. I can see the importance of not allowing devs to think that this is an acceptable way to recover from errors because the behavior is not consistent across browsers.  Having a better name that makes it more clear that this is only for observing errors to help with debugging.  I'd welcome the addition.\n\nI'd respectfully suggest that with a handler method you could keep it in your prod build and leave it up to the developer as to what they want to do.  The debug build could perhaps have the callback is defaulted to a function that logs to the console.  The prod build could have the callback defaulted to an empty function.  That way the builds would both be 100% backwards compatible, there would just be a new capability to handle errors differently if the user chose to override the default callback.\n\nTo make a case for having it in the prod build - what I actually plan to do in my handler is make a post to our logging service.  That way if this error ever gets triggered (due to errors in our coded that makes it out the door, specific browser issues, etc) I would see it happening via the error logs.\n\nThanks for the reply and for the code, it's made a huge improvement in load time on an app.  We have certain scripts that load only when you click certain parts of the page (for example clicking on a video will lazy load the necessary video streaming API script files).  I have LABjs loading the basic layout scripts on page load, and then loading more scripts in reaction to user input. It's really amazing how well it works!\n"

        "body": "Thank you for the bug report. Unfortunately, this is not a straightforward bug, because the per-script \"AllowDup\" flag was inadvertently/accidentally removed in LABjs 2.x rewrite. That explains why this detail was not noted in the release notes, nor was the documentation updated to reflect that it had been removed.\n\nAt this point, well over a year since 2.x came out, I'm left with the decision of whether or not to consider this a regression bug (did I intend to keep the feature and I failed to), or a documentation bug of failing to note that I intentionally removed it. I honestly don't even remember if I thought about the detail during the rewrite or not, so I don't know which way to think about it.\n\nThat having been said, it's a very minor feature that to this point no one has even noticed missing or \"broken\", even with significant amounts of usage of the library. I'm inclined to believe that whether it was intentional or accidental, it's a feature that proved by de facto that it should have been deprecated/removed, because it has so little real-world usage.\n\nSo, I'm marking this as a \"not a bug\" and \"won't fix\", and I will update the documentation and release notes to indicate that the feature was indeed removed.\n"

        "body": "> $LAB.runQueue(); is supposed to load previous queue (containing jQuery and everything else) and proceed to another.\n\nActually, no, this is not how LABjs is designed to work. The \"queue\" system is a totally separate chain (managed internally, but still a `$LAB` chain) from any other chain you create. The chains are totally independent, except for one caveat, and one special case condition, both of which I'll explain in a moment.\n\nBecause they are totally independent, you cannot rely on the fact that the queue is \"done\" in that it has both loaded **and** executed all the scripts, before moving onto the second chain you define. Both chains being independent means, in general, they will run in parallel, unaware of each other.\n\n> And actually that works flawlessly in any other browser except IE.\n\nThe reason for that is that IE uses a different loading technique than other browsers do, which is that IE has what I call \"true preloading\" meaning it can load a set of scripts and execute them (in order), independent of any other set of scripts that is loading. Other browsers do not have \"true preloading\", they have a slightly inferior (but still functional) behavior roughly called \"ordered async\".\n\nThe hallmark difference is that in \"ordered async\", all scripts (across all chains) will execute strictly in the order requested, so it has the side effect that \"accidentally\" your queue finishes executing before any scripts in your second chain can execute, even though in reality all your scripts in your second chain can finish loading and be ready to execute earlier.\n\nIn IE, once all the scripts in the second chain are ready, it executes, and is not \"blocked\" waiting on any other script executions on the page, so IE (ironically) has the truest **and most performant** behavior of all the browsers, compared to how LABjs is designed. With \"true preloading\", IE allows LABjs to have truly independent chains, whereas in other browsers, separate chains are logically (API-wise) independent but physically blocked on each other. So, that's the caveat mentioned above.\n\nBottom line, as your chains are designed currently, you have an inherent race condition, which is accidentally moot in other browsers but is exposed in IE. The solution is to avoid the inherent race condition, not rely on the accidental non-race condition in non-IE browsers.\n\n---\n\nI mentioned a special-case condition above, which I'll now explain. LABjs treats separate chains entirely logically independent, unless you create a condition where you want them to be logically \"connected\". Before I explain how to do so, let me say that this is basically not a great idea to do it this way. I would consider this a poor option, but it should work. I just mean to say that the better answer is to not create dependency between separate chains. Load everything in a single chain that depends on each other. If the queue system doesn't let you do that, don't use it, and instead do your own queueing (this is quite easy to do).\n\nAnyway, here's how you can create an implicit logical connection between two chains:\n\nThe `AllowDuplicates` option (which defaults to `false`) controls whether a LABjs chain will attempt to prevent the same script from being loaded multiple times. Naturally, if you set it to `true`, it will not do any checks, and will happily let as many in as you request. If you leave it at the default of `false`, it will check each time you request a script to see if that script has already been requested, and if so, will not load it.\n\nHere's the trick. If `AllowDuplicates` is set to `false` (again, that's the default, so no need to explicitly set it), and you have two chains that reference the same script URL (must match exactly!), then both chains will be forced to wait for that script as part of their normal defined execution order.\n\nSo, if both your queue and your second chain listed \"jquery.js\", and `AllowDuplicates` was indeed set as `false`, then the both the queue and the second chain will have to \"wait\" for \"jquery.js\" to execute, which would achieve the effect you want I believe. \"jquery.js\" will not be re-requested in this case, it will just create a logical dependency between the second chain and the queue.\n\n---\n\nTo reiterate my caution from above... taking advantage of this logical dependency between chains is not what I would consider \"best practice\". Not because it's gonna break (LABjs should function properly), but because it creates harder to debug code. It's much easier to debug, maintain, and debug based on the fact that independent chains are independent. When you create a subtle \"exception\" to this general rule, you create a footgun that could be \"dangerous\" in the future.\n\nIf LABjs had some sort of explicit way to logically link chains, that'd be a different story, because then it'd be obvious from examining code that the two chains are related. But because this is an extremely implicit, indirect side-effect behavior, it's not generally what I'd consider a good practice to rely on.\n\nIt's just slightly better than relying on observed browser behavior to moot a race condition. Most software developers would tell you not to rely on accidental behavior, and I consider this logical dependency between chains to be of that caliber. It will work, but if possible, I would encourage you to design to avoid it.\n"

        "body": "This is browser-dependent behavior that LABjs has no control over. There's poor spec'ing around how &lt;script> elements should behave with respect to loading errors. Some browsers will fire the `onload` handler even if it 404's, or 500's, others don't, or do so only for some errors and not others.\n\nLABjs is at the mercy of the browser. If it fires the load event, the chain will continue, if not, it won't. One of the many warts I wish the spec would iron out, but all my requests for them to do so have been ignored.\n\nFTR, in this particular scenario, I do _not_ think the chain should continue executing. Part of the \"promise\" that LABjs makes is that it will ensure execution order so you don't get cascading dependency issues. If you have two scripts which are separated by a `wait()`, LABjs needs to assume that's on purpose, because the first one is necessary for the second one. If the first one fails, there's no point in running the second one, only to create more failure, errors on the page, etc. Better to fail early.\n\nIf you have two scripts which are truly independent of each other, don't load them in the same chain with a `wait()` in between. Either use 2 chains, or remove the `wait()` so between them so the two scripts can execute \"in parallel\" and not block each other.\n"

        "body": "That almost works. What I think is happening is the Queue isn't running until the first chain ends. I have a bit of an interesting scenario, so let me go deeper.\n\nI want to defer all jquery stuff as well, at the top of my page i have \n\n``` javascript\nwindow.global = {}; global.buffer = []; global.ready = function (f) { global.buffer.push(f); };\n```\n\nso instead of doing a `$(function(){})` i do `global.ready(function(){})` and then later I have\n\n``` javascript\n\n//added by child page\n$LAB.queueScript('/pageSpecific.js')\n      .queueWait(function(){\n            global.ready(\n                function(){\n                  pageSpecific.init();\n                });\n        });\n\n$LAB.script('/jquery.js')\n      .wait(function(){ \n         $LAB.runQueue();\n      })\n      .wait(function(){\n              $.each(global.buffer, function (index, f) {\n                    $(f)\n              });\n      });\n```\n\nWith that I can queue up calls to init jquery plugins, or whatever and have them all executed at the very end. But like I mentioned at the beginning, it would appear as if the `.runQueue` call is not getting executed until the very end of the $LAB chain. \n\nThe problem is that the end of the first chain enumerates my buffer and executes all the functions I put in there. I think I can work around it by doing something like\n\n``` javascript\n$LAB.script().wait().....wait(function(){\n        $LAB.runQueue()\n              .wait(function(){\n                    $.each(global.buffer, function (index, f) {\n                         $(f)\n              });\n      });\n});\n```\n\ncan you confirm my suspicion on when runQueue is executed, and do you have any better solution to what I am trying to do?\n"

        "body": "`runQueue()` will run whenever you call it. So if you call it at the end of the chain, it will run then. If you call it earlier, it'll run then. There's no special logic inside it to defer or wait for any special event/time.\n\nHowever, the nature of script loading is asynchronous, which means that it won't COMPLETE its running right at that moment, but some little bit later, depending on loading speed, etc. So `runQueue()` starts the queue immediately, but it gives control back to your code (to finish other actions, like completing your $LAB chain) right after starting the queue, which means the end of the queue will come some time later.\n\nIf you need to wait until the end of the queue before you do something, you need to have a `queueWait()` call at the end of the queue, which does as it says on the label, and queues up a `wait()` to happen at the end of the queue's chain.\n\nI'm not entirely certain, but it sounds like what you actually have here is a case of two parallel asynchronous tasks, that you need to let both run in parallel, and finish in either order, and you just need to wait for both to complete before doing something else. In the parlance of your example, your two tasks would be: \"completion of the queue\" and \"completion of the $LAB chain\", and you have some set of code that you want to run ONLY once both those things are done.\n\nIn THAT case, you need a \"gate\", which means two or more parallel tasks (\"segments\"), where the gate doesn't open until all segments are complete. I happen to have written a small helper lib for exactly this kind of task, called \"asyncGate.js\": http://github.com/getify/asyncGate.js\n\nBasically, you could use it sorta like this:\n\n```\nvar gate = $AG(), \n      d1 = gate.and(),  // this is one gate segment trigger\n      d2 = gate.and()  // this is another gate segment trigger\n;\n\ngate.then(function(){\n   // run code that needs to wait on both segments of the gate to finish\n});\n\n$LAB.script(\"..\").script(\"..\").wait(function(){\n   /* ... */\n   d1();  // trigger one segment of the gate\n});\n\n$LAB.queueScript(\"..\").queueScript(\"..\").queueWait(function(){\n   /* ... */\n   d2();  // trigger second segment of the gate\n});\n```\n\nCheck the documentation for the \"asyncGate.js\" project, because there's multiple different ways you can use the API. I showed here a less common usage where you get the triggers directly and call them later. Another way is to create wrapper functions where the trigger is passed to you at the appropriate time. In either case, you call the trigger for each statement, and the gate's `then(...)` handler(s) will wait for all gate segments before firing.\n"

Your analysis of the problem (about \"loaded\") doesn't make sense to me given what I know about how script load events happen, because LABjs doesn't rely the state of \"loaded\" to know a script has executed.\n\n---\n\nNOTE: I don't have an IE10 instance to have been testing on, so the last time I tested LABjs was 10pp2 (which was the last on win7), and back then, it passed. If it fails now, it's probably some sort of regression in IE. Unfortunately, that might mean what I was complaining so much about IE10 not being available on win7 for testing, which is that they introduced a breaking bug that noone caught, and now it's way too late to get them to fix it.\n"

Now, my `<head>` looks like this, but the strange behavior still happens in IE7 and IE8, but not on Chrome:\n\n``` html\n<html>\n<head>\n    <meta http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" content=\"text/html; charset=utf-8\">\n    <meta http-equiv=\"Cache-Control\" content=\"no-cache\">\n    <title>Whatever title</title>\n    <link rel=\"stylesheet\" type=\"text/css\" href=\"./css/general.css\">\n    <link rel=\"stylesheet\" type=\"text/css\" href=\"./css/ui-lightness/jquery-ui.css\">\n    <script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"./js/init.js\"></script>\n</head>\n<body>\n    ...\n</body>\n</html>\n```\n\nand within my init.js:\n\n``` javascript\n(function(o){/*...lab.js source code minified here...*/})(this);\n\n$LAB.setGlobalDefaults({BasePath:\"./js/\"});\n$LAB.script(\"libs/jquery-1.8.0.min.js\").wait()\n    .script(\"libs/jquery-ui-1.8.23.min.js\")\n    .script(\"script1.js\")\n    .script(\"script2.js\")\n\n    //...and much more loaded here...\n\n    .wait(function(){\n        $(function(){\n            //Actual init code here, to be executed on DOM ready...\n            //...\n        });\n    });\n```\n\nIn Chrome, the interesting thing I observe however is that in the DOM, the `<head>` element contains the `<script>` tags in the opposite order to what i asked them to be loaded. I guess that doesn't matter much, as their execution is constrained by the final `.wait()`, but I would intend to see the scripts appended to the `<head>` rather than prepended. Is this a desired behavior ?\n\nBTW, email sent with some screenshots explaining the actual issue.\n\nThanks for you help\n"

        "body": "My working theory is that the error you said you were getting reported from jquery has something to do with your code building or modifying the DOM in such a way that the CSS in question should be applied, but for some reason your code execution order is different in IE than in other browsers (usually indicates a race condition).\n\nLike I've said, LABjs doesn't modify anything about how the browser deals with CSS, so I continue to be 99% sure this is a red herring and not the actual symptom/issue.\n\nIn any case, to determine is this might actually be a LABjs bug, I'd need a much more reduced and simple test case. Your use case is quite complex for testing and isolating a bug, so that's why the few minutes here and there that I've had to look at things haven't revealed anything useful.\n\nNOTE: you've indicated symptoms that if you load things with normal script tags, things work, but if you load them dynamically with LABjs, they don't work. That USUALLY means you have an execution race condition somewhere in your logic. Try setting the `AlwaysPreserveOrder` option to `true`, or put a `wait()` after each and every `script()` call, and see if that affects anything. The `wait()` only controls execution, not parallel loading, so even with them in place, you should still get the dynamic loading benefits.\n"

        "body": "Hi Kyle,\n\nI've tried several tests in regard to your advices, and the result is quite surprising.\n\nI first tried to use the `AlwaysPreserveOrder`, to put a `.wait()` after every `.script()` call, and even both, but noneworked better.\n\nSo I then tried to test with a minimal test case to have your step in my weird bus :)\nThe thing is, I even commented out almost everything, and I noticed that my script that is having a hard time working with LABjs is `html5shiv.js` (A project to be able to use HTML5 tags in old browers : http://code.google.com/p/html5shiv/ ).\nIf in my html page, I load that script using `<script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"html5shiv.js\"></script>`, then the page styles correctly those HTML5 elements.\nHowever, if I use the following code, then the file is not loaded (or at least, not at the right moment regarding the browser's CSS rules application):\n\n``` html\n<!DOCTYPE html>\n<html>\n    <head>\n    <meta http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" content=\"text/html; charset=utf-8\">\n    <title>...</title>\n    <link rel=\"stylesheet\" type=\"text/css\" href=\"general.css\"/>\n    <script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"init.js\"></script>\n</head>\n<body>\n    ...\n```\n\nand then **init.js**:\n\n``` javascript\n(function(o){...LAB.min.js copied inline here...})(this);\n\n$LAB.setGlobalDefaults({ AlwaysPreserveOrder : true });\n$LAB.script(\"html5shiv.js\");\n```\n\nSo we're coming close I believe, but then I can't figure out why LABjs is troubling the browser that way...\nCurrently then, I forced the `html5shiv.js` to be loaded in a &lt;script> tag before my `init.js` which loads every other modules. The page now displays fine in every browsers and every versions.\nI'd prefer anyway to have it loaded like all the other scripts, and not having to make an exception of its case...\n\nWhat you think ?\n"

Browser downloads the page\n2. It applys the style\n   - Browser runs into an HTML5 tag and doesn't know what it is...the tag is ignored\n3. Lab chain runs and executes the HTML5 shiv\n\nHow would the browser know to style the HTML5 element without the shiv being loaded? You need to load the shiv BEFORE the lab chain runs to make the execution flow like\n1. Browser downloads the page\n2. Scripts are executed...Html5Shiv loaded \n3. It applys the style\n   - Browser runs into an HTML5 tag and _now knows_ what to do\n4. Lab chain runs the rest of the JS\n\nThis is how I do it, and I don't really notice any performance impact. Essential scripts like the Html5Shiv just need to be loaded like this. If you have your server set up properly the shiv will be cached and the user won't have to download it with every request.  (or use a CDN). In fact, the Html5Shiv site even says\n\n> It must be included before the < body > element (i.e. in the < head >) \n\nLoading it via LAB.js just isn't going to work. Sorry :/\n"

There are certain scripts that people use which cannot be dynamically loaded, because the nature of how they work is that they must be present at the very beginning of markup processing, which is contrary to what dynamic script loading does.\n\nModernizr is an example of this type script. It has to run before the `<body>` tag. It looks like this shiv is the same way, because it appears that the way it works is to actually patch the underlying DOM APIs of the browser so that when unrecognized tags are found, it fakes how they should be handled.\n\nAnother example of a script that is incompatible with dynamic loading would be any script which uses `document.write()` in it. Different reason, same result: can't load them dynamically.\n"

        "body": "I'm not outright \"against\" this suggestion, but I'm not totally convinced it's worth changing the core LABjs to do it. I'm at least willing to explore it.\n\n`<soapbox>`\nUsually when people make suggestions for changing LABjs, there end up being ways that they could wrap behavior and get the same outcome, which prevents any \"change tax\" from being imposed on the masses. Part of the reason LABjs is \"closed\" is basically because I think stability is a really strong virtue in such projects, and I don't like the strain and tax of other projects that just seem to constantly be updating and changing, for what seems like no reason. For instance, most of what jQuery keeps changing to do, I have no need for. But I have to keep changing because I need to keep up with whatever the latest jQuery does, for bug fixes, browser supports, plugin compat, etc. I find that annoying to an great extent.\n`</soapbox>`\n\nTo your particular feature request... I wonder if we could address this interesting use case by wrapping the `console.log()` statement to \"filter\" out the messages you don't want. For instance, running something like this snippet (of course, only in dev mode where you have LABjs set to debug mode) right before using LABjs (and perhaps restoring the `console.log` to its original form after the final `wait()` in your chain executes successfully):\n\n```\n(function(){\n   var clog;\n   if (console && console.log) {\n      clog = console.log;\n      console.log = function(msg) {\n         if (msg && (msg.match(/^(?:start\\s)?script\\s(?:(?:pre)?load|execution)/) || msg.match(/^\\$LAB\\.wait/))) return;\n         clog.apply(console,arguments);\n      };\n   }\n})();\n\nconsole.log(\"start script preload ...\")\nconsole.log(\"start script load ...\")\nconsole.log(\"script preload ...\")\nconsole.log(\"script execution ...\")\nconsole.log(\"$LAB.wait ...\")\nconsole.log(\"anything else...\")\nanything else...\n```\n\nWhat do you think about an approach like that?\n"

I've been petitioning the spec and browsers to give us more flexible script loading mechanisms. No such luck yet.\n\nOther script loading solutions rely on the AMD module pattern to wrap all scripts in a \"module definition\" wrapper, like Require.js and such. They get around the problem you're seeing by basically preventing ALL scripts from \"auto executing\" so you get to decide when you want to execute by declaring when and where you want to import a module to another module. That sort of pattern is, I think, overkill in almost all cases, but it is very popular for how a lot of people handle this.\n\nInstead of AMD (and Require.js) I would suggest you consider re-arranging how you load your scripts so you can avoid this problem.\n\nThe best way is NOT to list \"mobile_core.js\" to be loaded inside of \"core.js\", but instead have the check for whether \"mobile_core.js\" is needed out in the same place your main $LAB chain is listed, that way a single $LAB chain can do all your loading, either including the mobile file or not, at the appropriate location in the sequence.\n\nThe other slightly less optimal way is to always load this mobile file, but have THAT FILE do the check for whether it's needed or not, and if not, that file just skips all its stuff and does nothing.\n\nUnfortunately, LABjs can't solve this problem for you, but hopefully I've given you some ways to think about the problem differently so you can perhaps avoid it yourself.\n"

        "body": "Hey Getify, \n\nthanks for responding so quickly. Below is our setup, which we did not change when we upgraded from 1.2 to 2.0.\n\n$LAB ready function with a check for myFunction which is in promo.js (loaded with $LAB)\n\n``` javascript\n$LAB.ready(function(){\n    if(myFunction){\n        $ajax call\n    }\n```\n\n$LAB call:\n\n``` javascript\n// Load all js files with $LAB                          \n        $LAB    \n        .script(\"/js/jquery.min.js\").wait() \n        .script(\"/js/jquery-ui-light.min.js\").wait()\n        /*... 17 more scripts ...*/\n        .script(\"/js/promo.js\").wait()\n        .wait($LAB.run);\n```\n\nWe use $LAB.ready quite a bit on our homepage, to ensure proper sequencing as the page is mainly a header/footer with a big unstructured content area.\n\nSo with the above setup, when we went to version 2.0, our page load times increased by 1 second over a large dataset. So we reverted to 1.2, but are taking the hit with the IE10 issue. In IE10, the reference to if(myFunction) is returning an error - myFunction is undefined.\n\nSo the biggest issue for us is figuring out what was causing the increase in page load times.\n"

        "body": "2.0 was a complete rearchitecture/rewrite of LABjs from the ground-up. In 2.0, there should have been nothing but performance improvements, though, ESPECIALLY for IE. The technique used in IE is what I call \"real preloading\" in that it actually preloads all the JS code and then executes them in order. So, in theory, this should perform better in IE than it would in say Firefox, which uses another trick.\n\nI'm pretty perplexed by what you're seeing. My guess is that you're getting false readings of the site being finished loading earlier in IE than it is (because of 1 or more scripts not finishing loading), and so the \"increase\" is actually just a correction to what it should have been. But, I have no way to back that up as more than a wild guess.\n\nI'd really have to take a look at your actual page in action, and monitor it in IE, and see. But even then, it's going to be nearly impossible to correlate that to aggregated stats from gomez. It's also going to be very hard to try something and then have to wait for new stats before we know if it helped or hurt.\n\nMoreover, LABjs does absolutely nothing to hold up (or change the hold-up) of window.onload, which is what I guess gomez is using to determine \"page load\".\n\nOne other wild guess is that perhaps you're loading duplicate scripts (and LABjs has different behavior around dupes in 1.x vs 2.0).\n\nBTW, why are you loading 17 scripts? Best practice would be to be loading 2-3 scripts at most. I usually recommend people combine all code into one file, then split that file in half (or something like that) and load the parts via LABjs. I'd say if a production site is having to load more than say 5 scripts, it's probably not doing what it could or should be doing for optimization.\n"

Our typical times were in the 1.4-1.5 seconds, and when we implemented 2.0 it jumped to 2.5. \n\nI will do some additional digging - track down additional numbers and see if there are conflicts elsewhere.\n\nA colleague may join in the conversation here as well.\n"

        "body": "This question has been asked many times over the years, if we can provide a way of adding arbitrary attributes to script tags. I personally consider that to be an anti-pattern, so I've resisted... but the other point is that there's not always going to be a script tag to attach things to. For instance, if local XHR is used instead of a script tag.\n\nMoreover, it's a slippery slope where people will want to add more and more stuff to script tags if possible, so we'll have to have general attribute systems (like @fletc3her is suggesting). I'm not saying those things are bad, per se, just that I don't see why that's useful to a broad enough set of the users of LABjs to be in core.\n\nLastly, you can't necessarily guarantee that you can find the script element that has the attributes you're looking for, as there could be multiple tags with the same URL, or there could be script elements with no URL (like in the case of script injection from XHR), or the script elements might be removed from the DOM after use, etc. Given all these complications (and others), and since the fidelity of finding the script element you added this data too is pretty low, I don't see the point to adding this to core.\n\nWhy not just maintain some global variable with the data in question? I understand lots of libs do this anti-pattern of relying on adding attributes to script tags and so you can't help that. But that still doesn't make it a good pattern to follow/endorse, IMO.\n\n---\n\nI guess my bottom line is that the stability of LABjs (over 2 years now since last bug fix was needed) is more important than adding small features that only some side use cases would benefit from. The thousands of sites that would have to ask if they should upgrade or not isn't really worth the small gain, IMHO.\n\nBut that's part of why this code IS stable, and IS open-source and MIT licensed, so that it can encourage lots of forks for individual needs, and the barrier to you maintaining your own fork is low, because I don't change core at every possible chance to add things. Imagine how much harder it would be for people to maintain forks for their own needs if I was having the core be patched regularly with community requests.\n\nJust a balancing act against various tradeoffs. Thanks for the input and suggestions, though. :)\n"

It is not for debugging (when you typically don't work with a CDN and don't have cross origin issues).\n\nI have regularly over the years recommended to users of LABjs that they take the debug build of LABjs (which is a little bit bigger, and runs a few extra bits of logic at each step) and deploy it into their production site, so they can debug issues that seem to only be reproducible in their prod environment.\n\nBut note, this sort of action is still fundamentally a debugging step, and should be considered, IMO, a temporary step while you diagnose and fix issues. It should not be a permanent installation in a prod environment. For example, debug mode by default logs all the steps LABjs takes to the console, but that sort of logging is extraneous for a production environment, and moreover, could be considered a \"leak\" of implementation you would probably be best served avoiding for prod.\n\nAll the debug features of LABjs are specifically for the purpose of debugging issues and correcting them. That means all of those features should be temporary, not permanent, in prod. As such, I have a hard time believing we've come up with a new fundamentally \"debugging\" feature for LABjs that would be constantly running (and deployed) on a permanent basis in production. That sorta violates one of my fundamental principles of good software design.\n\n**CAN** you do that? Of course. It's not something I'd ever recommend. LABjs is not really designed to be a tool in the RUM toolbox, it's not for continuous monitoring or stats/error gathering, etc. If I were to design that sort of software, I'd probably approach it quite differently than how I built LABjs. By contrast, LABjs is as simple and stripped down and bare metal as it possibly can be, because it has one task and one task only: loading scripts. Any of its capabilities to track or provide assistance in debugging are intended for debugging purposes only.\n\nThis is a similar discussion (and mindset) to me as [issue #57](https://github.com/getify/LABjs/issues/57) where there was quite a bit of back-n-forth discussion about my design philosophy of defaulting to having the `wait()` method suppress errors by default, and only expose them when you choose to move into `Debug:true` mode (and of course, using the debug build of the lib). Several people in that thread definitely disagreed with that being the default behavior, but I considered that to be the more appropriate conservative default for simple production environments, while giving the power and flexibility to someone to use a different build/mode if they need to dig into an issue.\n\nMy mindset then, and now, is that LABjs is best served by being as stripped down, and conservative, as possible in the core minified build, and debug functionality is tucked away in the debug build, easily useable if necessary to track down and fix problems. Hopefully that helps elaborate on how I might tend to approach **this** feature request, if we do add it.\n"

        "body": "@toxcct \nYou are correct in your observation that some types of \"script failed to load\" will in fact cause a chain to break. Other types will let it keep going (though the lack of dependency can cause JS errors).\n\nHowever, this is not controlled by LABjs at all, thus it's not something I can fix. Browsers are inconsistent on how they handle the `load` event. Some of them will fire the load event even in a 404 condition (which, if you think about it, is totally wrong), and others (most, thankfully) won't. On the flip side, these same inconsistencies exist with the `error` event. You'd think that either the `load` or the `error` event should always fire. Unfortunately, that's not the case. Sometimes neither fires, sometimes both fire (bizarrest of all!).\n\nBottom line: LABjs can't really rely on either event, so it just assumes that `load` will definitely fire in a successful loading case, and it basically punts on handling the \"didn't correctly load\" case. So, unfortunately, I can't do anything about the fact that the chain stops when one fails to load.\n\nBTW: others in the past have addressed \"fallback\" behavior like this (ie, what to do when something fails to load) by setting up a timeout and just making some assumptions about a failed load if a certain amount of time goes by. I don't recommend that, per se, but that's how some people have gotten around this.\n"

For my part, I wouldn't mind if the load event is fired if the page requested in the address bar is retrieved but not all the relative contents, like images (but you got me unprepared on this question, and never really thought about that anyway :-) ).\n\nFor the error event, I was more thinking of a way to get the status of the XHR object. This way, you could have a first serious check on how a script was retrieved (if the status is \"OK\", then you can proceed, but if the status is \"Not found\", then the chain could fall back in an error callback if provided, or continue with the default behavior if not).\nI'm especially thinking of how jQuery is allowing to retrieve content and to handle the success and error cases...\n\nI've barelly seen how @jasonhinkle forked LABjs to add his own handling, but i'm not sure this is what i'm after though.\n"

If that's what you're asking for, that's quite an ambitious task, and I just want to level-set that I won't be authoring that for you here, nor should you expect any other open-source project to just do that for you, in their documentation.\n\nOTOH, that's an admirable type of project to do, so I'd encourage you to build one to your suiting, and make sure you open-source it as you do, so that the community can contribute to and benefit from it as you explore those use cases.\n\nNow, at a simpler level, if you're asking how could my script loader (LABjs) used in such a theoretical project, that IS something I can speak to.\n\nLABjs is a dynamic script loader, which means you can load one or more scripts at any time, not just at page-load time. You can, at any time, request 1 or more scripts, using `.script(..)` API calls, and they will default to loading in parallel and running ASAP. If you need for there to be an enforced execution order, you can call `.wait(..)` calls in between them, which will not affect loading but will affect execution order to preserve it.\n\nSo, whatever higher-level abstractions you build in such a page-loader framework, at the point when you need to fetch a script, it's a simple as invoking `$LAB.script(..)` and then using a `.wait(..)` with a callback to be notified when it finishes. That's LABjs's strong suit, is making that sort of on-demand loading incredibly simple.\n\nIt would be up to you implement all the other abstraction on top of LABjs, however.\n"

Because the actual underlying web platform's functionality doesn't give us a way to do this directly, we have to do hacks.

        "body": "@sergeevabc \nWhat you've shown is conceptually similar to how I use LABjs in my own projects. I call it making a \"bootsrapper\" file, and I usually call it \"load.js\", but I inline the minified production LABjs code, then I include the $LAB chain as necessary for my own project. Then I load just that one file with a normal `<script>` tag, at the bottom of the `<body>`, and it's responsible for loading up the rest of the code for the page.\n\nI have some light conditional stuff in there, so what you're showing is much more complex/capable (deciding files based upon the page you're in), but conceptually it's the same idea. I endorse that as a good pattern.\n\nIf you got yourself a more and more complex/capable mechanism for doing conditional loading based on the page URL (routing), you might make yourself a little mini-lib (similar to LABjs) that you just drop in, instead of having that sort of ad-hoc custom code there. That'd make it easier for you to re-use on other projects later, and be a great candidate for releasing as open-source as a help to others in the community as a contrib.\n\nAs for how to do \"fallback\" style loading, \n\nWhat you may want to do in the above code is the same concept, but instead of using the `queueScript()` and `queueWait()` (which are simple helpers built statically onto the `$LAB` API), you'd want to do queueing yourself.\n\nFor example:\n\n``` js\n\n// NOTE: I've slightly modified this function to pass in a $LAB chain to use.\n\nfunction loadOrFallback($L,scripts,idx) {   \n   function testAndFallback() {   \n      clearTimeout(fallback_timeout);   \n      if (successfully_loaded) return; // already loaded successfully, so just bail   \n      try {   \n         scripts[idx].test();   \n         successfully_loaded = true; // won't execute if the previous \"test\" fails   \n         scripts[idx].success();   \n      } catch(err) {   \n         if (idx < scripts.length-1) loadOrFallback($L,scripts,idx+1);   \n      }   \n   }   \n\n   if (idx == null) idx = 0;   \n   $L = $L.script(scripts[idx].src).wait(testAndFallback);   \n   var fallback_timeout = setTimeout(testAndFallback,10*1000); // only wait 10 seconds\n   return $L;\n}\n\n\n\nvar _queue = [];\n\n// page 1?\nif (document.location.href.match(/ ... /)) {\n   _queue.push([\n      {src:\"http://mycdn.com/page-1.js\", test: ..., success: ...),   \n      {src:\"http://anothercdn.com/page-1.js\", test: ..., success: ...),   \n      {src:\"page-1.js\", test: ..., success: ...)\n   ]);\n}\n// page 2?\nelse if (...) {\n   _queue.push(\"page-2-dependency-a.js\", false, \"page-2-dependency-b.js\", false);\n   _queue.push([\n      {src:\"http://mycdn.com/page-2.js\", test: ..., success: ...),   \n      {src:\"http://anothercdn.com/page-2.js\", test: ..., success: ...),   \n      {src:\"page-2.js\", test: ..., success: ...)\n   ]);\n}\n// page 3?\n...\n\n// later, process the queue\nvar i, $L;\n\nfor (i=0; i<_queue.length; i++) {\n   if (Object.prototype.toString.call(_queue[i]) === \"[object Array]\") {\n      $L = loadOrFallback($L,_queue[i]);\n   }\n   else if (typeof _queue[i] === \"boolean\") {\n      $L = $L.wait();\n   }\n   else if (typeof _queue[i] === \"string\") {\n      $L = $L.script(_queue[i]);\n   }\n   else if (typeof _queue[i] === \"function\") {\n      $L = $L.wait(_queue[i]);\n   }\n}\n```\n\nNOTE: this for-loop process is what I call \"simulated chaining\", and I wrote about it awhile back in this blog post: http://blog.getify.com/simulated-chaining-in-javascript/\n\nNow, the huge caveat: $LAB does not allow you to basically \"pause\" a chain, because that functionality doesn't exist in the underlying web platform. What I mean by this is, we can't really combine the idea of having chained dependencies, as I've shown above, with the idea of having one part of the chain that sorta forks off and re-tries or tries other fallback URLs, while holding up the rest of the chain. You can't pause the main chain and fork off this child processing for one item in the main chain.\n\nBottom line: the above code might kinda work like you want, but you may also notice mal-behavior in the fallback case, because the way the above code works is that if a script has to fallback or be retried, it's doing that in a separate $LAB chain from the main chain processing the dependencies, and as such, you may have code that depends on your file having loaded, but that code didn't wait for all the different attempts at that one file.\n\nYou can probably see now why this topic is so complicated that it's not something I was ever going to bury inside of LABjs. You end up having to make a whole bunch of judgement calls about how to handle these functionality quirks and deficiencies. It's just one of those \"hard\" things you have to figure out how it works for you, even though there may be a dozen other ways to do it that others would prefer.\n"

If a browser fires a load event, LABjs assumes the script loaded and ran, and if it doesn't fire the load event, LABjs just waits. LABjs has absolutely no control over what conditions the load or error events fire, and notably (as you're seeing), browsers don't agree on these conditions.\n\nI have multiple times tried to convince the WHATWG group that the spec needs to clearly define under what conditions exactly the load and error events fire, and that those conditions have no overlap or gap (there's always one or the other, and it's predictable). I have been told repeatedly that the spec already has as much detail as they intend, and that it's up to the browsers to decide to agree or not, as they see fit.\n\nSo, unfortunately, my bad news is for you is there's nothing I can do, and all my best efforts to advocate for the actual problem to be fixed have been rejected. :(\n"

I don't know what scripts are loading and if any of them container other script loads.   To do it in parallel the loader would be able to load 1,4,5 parallel, execute 1 when 5 is ready see that 1 loads 2 and 3 and then wait to execute 4,5 till after 2 and 3 load.

        "body": "What you're referring to is what I call \"nested dependency annotation\", which amounts to not having an external listing of the script dependencies, but instead of having dependencies only listed inside each file. As you note, because the page doesn't know about \"2.js\" and \"3.js\" until after \"1.js\" finishes loading, it can't do all 3 of them in parallel, it has to load \"1.js\" first, then \"2.js\" and \"3.js\".\n\nMoreover, no script loader is able to actually stop/pause the execution of 4 and 5 if 1 asks to load 2 and 3. There is simply no way to do this cross-browser using what the web platform gives to us. LABjs (and most other script loaders) rely on creating `<script>` elements and as I said before, we're not given any control over when those scripts execute (or delaying that execution). The scripts will always execute ASAP after loading. Sucks, but that's just what we've been given.\n\nI've petitioned the WHATWG group(s) for \"true script preloading\" (which is already present in IE 4+, btw!) which WOULD let you have this control. But they've rejected that effort for over 2+ years, and so none of other browsers support it.\n\nThe only way to do it is to XHR Ajax to load your scripts, and then execute them in the order you want, meaning you can defer when you execute 4 and 5 if necessary. But then, if you want to XHR files, they either have to be same-domain, or you can only cross-domain load in browsers that support CORS, which reduces the number of (old) browsers you can support.\n\nThe only other option is to do what AMD-style loaders do, which is that you force ALL of your scripts to be wrapped in `function() { ... }` wrappers. This allows scripts to load and run in any order, but the actual logic inside each file is wrapped in a function so it doesn't auto-execute, and then you can come along later and execute those payloads in the order you want.\n\nThe downside there is obvious: every file you load this way has to be wrapped.\n\n---\n\nWhat I tell people to do (and indeed, what I do myself) is not to rely on nested-dependency-annotation with LABjs. Instead, have a build tool that reads those files, and finds all the nested dependencies, and constructs a list of scripts that's complete and has the right order (like 1,2,3,4,5), and then have that build tool load all scripts at once, like using a LABjs chain.\n"

        "body": "A whole bunch of people over the years have asked for \"error handling\" support in LABjs. Search through the closed issues archive and you'll probably find at least half a dozen threads on this topic.\n\nMy answer has always remained consistent: the problem with supporting an \"error handling\" API in LABjs is that the underlying platform is not consistent with respect to what constitutes an error or not. The `onerror` handler fires in different conditions depending on platform and browser and version. In fact, there are some bizarre cases where neither `onload` nor `onerror` fire, and possibly even cases where both fire.\n\nThis inconsistency is unacceptable. But it's not anything that LABjs can do anything about. We're just stuck until/if the web platform standards bodies agree to my repeated requests to fully standardize this behavior.\n\nI don't want to put an API into LABjs which behaves inconsistently. If I do that, invariably, LABjs will get blamed when some such error happens in Chrome and not IE, etc. I have no desire to field \"support\" such erroneous and misdirected \"bug reports\".\n\nLABjs' philosophy always has been \"load all scripts in parallel, preserve execution order where desired\". And that's it. It doesn't provide facilities for error handling, graceful recovery, etc. People have come up with all kinds of external work-arounds for such behaviors, as hacks, but I remain unconvinced that any of that belongs in LABjs core to weigh it down and to provide more surface area for people to misunderstand and misblame LABjs.\n"

        "body": "OK, I can now see a sensible depiction of the changes.\n\nAll this analysis I'm going to put down here, it's not new. I've been saying this same things, in parts, over and over again, for years on these threads. I've been very consistent in my perspective. But I continue to leave the door open if someone has any reasonable counter-arguments to change the balance. I don't think it'll happen, but open-source is partly about having these debates and always being willing to accept more evidence.\n\nHere's several thoughts:\n1. Error handling is not a _primary_ use-case for LABjs. At best, it's a secondary/lesser use-case, but in reality, given the tens of thousands who use it without error handling right now, and the few dozen who forked LABjs for error handling types of approaches, you could argue it's kind of niche.\n   \n   For niche or lesser use-cases, the bar is pretty high for the comparative of value to LoC. LABjs is small on purpose, because the major argument against script loading is not loading more code just to load your code. The bigger it is, even a couple of hundred bytes, the less it even makes sense for LABjs to even be used. It is currently, at 2k post-gzip, almost as big as is tolerable.\n   \n   There's lots of features and use-cases we _could_ put into LABjs. Many have asked over the years. I have remained unconvinced that the value overcomes the bloating (even a little bit) of the core LABjs.\n   \n   The code you've submitted looks to be sensible and of good quality. But there's 99 additions and 13 deletions. That's an **_awful lot of code**_ comparatively to be added to LABjs core. I'm not nearly convinced that this feature is useful enough to warrant such a change. Just by estimate, I've not tried it yet, my guess is that this change adds at least 200-300 of post-gzip bytes to the weight of LABjs. That may not sound like a lot, but 10-15% increase is huge in the world of script loaders.\n2. Similar to a bar being high to add stuff into LABjs making it bigger, there's also a very high bar for adding stuff into LABjs to create a new release.\n   \n   I've said a number of times, and I mean it, that the most useful feature of LABjs is its stability. I take the stability very seriously. The reason for that is that to make a change to a piece of code which has been embedded tens of thousands of times on sites across the web, IMO there has to be a really compelling reason to make a new release, and then force all those sites/apps/devs to think about whether or not they should update.\n   \n   If they do update, it's extra mental tax on them to re-validate that nothing changed. If they don't update, they risk getting out of sync with LABjs. Since there's a lot of people who use forked versions of LABjs where they've each added in their own little tweaks, the more I change the core LABjs, the more difficult I make it on them to manage the merge of those changes, and with such a widespread change as you've proposed, it almost certainly will create merge conflicts for some of them.\n   \n   To risk doing that to so many devs, there has to be a strong reason why. I'm not sure that adding a lesser use-case like error handling meets that bar. In fact, I feel like it doesn't, or at least I'm not convinced yet.\n3. There's a philosophical dissonance at play, too. What exactly is the point of having error handling in production code?\n   \n   Is it so you can monitor and report errors? I think there are plenty of other monitoring solutions that are better suited. If I was designing LABjs to be primarily a monitoring or remote-logging tool, I would have designed it quite differently than I did. Bolting on error handling so you can monitor real-time error conditions feels unnatural to the core purpose of LABjs.\n   \n   Is it so you can \"recover\" from errors more gracefully? That sounds nice in theory, but in practice it usually fails to be true. The web already has a built-in \"recover from errors\" and it's called \"refresh\". The chances are low that you had a temporary outage (for a brief few milliseconds) on one of your scripts loading, but only a few milliseconds later, now you can retry that load, and it'll work.\n   \n   When you start to analyze how you'd actually use error handling in the real world, this use-case becomes less and less concrete and more and more niche. I don't think there's more than a few dozen sites on the entire web that care so deeply about error handling and recovery in production that they'd go to all the manual trouble it would be to architect their entire app around the possibility of conditional script-load retries or other such exotic techniques.\n   \n   And for the tens of thousands of others who use LABjs, all this extra code you're proposing would be unnecessary dead weight, because they wouldn't use it, except for...\n4. **_If**_ we added this feature, it feels like it's a dev-mode/debug-mode feature at most. I can't see it being in the production core build.\n   \n   In other words, I have other code which is included only in the \"debug\" version of the code, which is intended only for debugging issues in dev, and not for production. This error handling seems like it **_might**_ make it easier to troubleshoot some types of problems while in dev mode (like wrong script paths, etc).\n5. The single biggest reason I've resisted \"error handling\" for LABjs is the lack of consistency it introduces. I said that earlier in the thread without explaining, so let me expand upon that.\n   \n   First, there's the question that `onerror` fires on script elements in different conditions in different browsers. Some browsers fire it when there's a 404, but not when there's a 500. Some fire it on 500's but not on 404's. You can imagine if you start chasing down other status codes, you find lots of other inconsistencies.\n   \n   The only thing worse than an intermittent error you're trying to debug is when that error is not even consistent in different browsers. This kind of weirdness is **_very opaque to end users of LABjs**_, so it's almost certainly going to lead to people blaming LABjs for bugs rather than the underlying browser.\n   \n   Second, **_and most important of all**_, is that the web platform does not allow us to stop the script loading of the rest of the chain when an unrecoverable error happens. The way the chain API of LABjs is designed, a dev would expect that if they are loading 5 scripts, and file 1 and 2 load, but file 3 fails, then 4 and 5 would be abandoned/aborted and **_not run**_. But this is impossible to accomplish through the library. The only hope is a dev who programs every single file very defensively, but that is not common, especially when you're using files from other third-parties.\n   \n   For example, if file 3 fails, and we report that error, but file 4 and 5 also try to run, and they depend on 3, and they certainly fail, but then do so in an extravagantly bad way, like they add an event handler on browser scroll or in a timer, and that handler is going to fail every single time it's called, then your error log in your browser can quickly fill up and overload, and obscure the actual root of the problem.\n   \n   Worse, the error handling message for the script failing to load can't be predicted when it will happen (because of various timings issues internally), so it could happen at the top, bottom, or smack in the middle of a big stack of other errors, making it likely very hard to find reliably, even across page loads.\n   \n   If you try to architect a scenario where you detect file 3 failing, and you try a fallback URL for file 3, or retry the load of file 3 a few times before giving up, and you want 4 and 5 to wait, you can't delay them while you try to recover from 3 failing. Unless you've taken **_lots**_ of extra care in the design of 4 and 5, this is almost certainly going to cause cascading and totally unrecoverable errors.\n   \n   In almost all cases, hitting refresh is going to be the only reliable recovery, which moots most of the usage of this error handling anyway.\n\n---\n\nBoiling all this down, on the surface error handling is extremely sensible (in theory), but in practice it really falls apart. There's just nowhere near the value-add to overcome all the caveats, bugs, inconsistencies, and extra bloat, to justify adding it to LABjs.\n\nBut again, that's just my _current_ view. I remain open to other evidence/arguments.\n"

Thanks!\n\nI'm using v2.0.3, here's the test on the web:\nhttp://www.data-diggers.com/test/test.html\n\nNote: It gets even bit more stranger. In Opera 9.63 if I hit Refresh the script executes as expected, but if I just load it again (type the address again without refreshing it ) the script misbahaves and wait() body is executed immediately. Maybe it's caching issue? It seems that if the script is cached control to .wait() is passed right away without waiting for script execution to finish.\n"

I will certainly investigate what's going on and try to reproduce and diagnose.\n\nIf it's a bug that can be fixed in LABjs, the chances of a new release of LABjs to fix it are slim (given how minority/legacy a browser Opera 9.x is). The best you could probably expect is a suggestion on how to patch your copy of LABjs.\n\nMore likely though, it could be a newly introduced bug in a port of Opera to a newer platform, in which case that's completely the fault of the browser and may very well be nothing LABjs can do about it. At that point, you'd have to contact Opera about it, but since they have long since retired support for Opera 9.x, I'm not sure how much help they'd be.\n\nNot trying to scare you off. I'll do my best to figure it out, as soon as I get some free time. It may be a bit. And I just wanted to warn you that the resolution may be less than desirable. But we'll see. :)\n"

By design, the library blocks execution of script B until after script A has successfully run, _if_ you have specified via a `wait()` call in between the two `script()` calls that there _is_ such an execution order dependency.\n\nThere's an implicit assumption with the usage of LABjs that if B depends on A, and you therefore use `wait()` to tell B not to execute until A completes, then B cannot and should not run if A doesn't successfully run, no matter what. So the question becomes, in your case, does B depend on A, or not?\n\nIf B _does_ depend on A, then LABjs is doing the correct thing by not letting B run if A never runs. If B _doesn't_ depend on A, then don't put B after A in a chain with a `wait()` in between them. If they are execution-order independent, then either load them in parallel (aka, with no `wait()` in between them) or load them in two separate `$LAB` chains.\n"

I'm not sure if you went to the fiddle page and saw the code, but the anonymous function is part of it's on separate $LAB.queueWait() call.  The implication being that it should be queued and executed in turn but is not dependent upon the previous $LAB.queueScript() call.  At least, that is my understanding of the documentation (which, I'm perfectly fine with admitting that understanding is flawed if, in fact, I'm incorrect).  \n\nThanks for your reply!\n\nthnx,\nChristoph\n"

        "body": "I have been asked to do this before, but it was an intentional design choice way back at the beginning, not a mistake, not to support LABjs being relative to the `<base>` tag of a page. Back then, `<base>` tags were a big problem for IE6, and moreover, back then (at least), IE didn't support `document.baseURI`. \n\nSo I elected to instead add the `BasePath` [configuration](http://labjs.com/documentation.php#setglobaldefaults) to allow relative URLs. **Note:** the `BasePath` should be absolute, and not relative (as it itself would be considered relative to the page, which will likely produce strange results).\n\n``` js\nLAB.setGlobalDefaults({ BasePath: \"http://some.tld/other/path\" });\n\n// or\n\nLAB.setOptions({ BasePath: \"http://some.tld/other/path\" })\n.script(...)\n...\n```\n\nSo, if you set the LAB configuration `BasePath` to the same as the absolute value in your `<base>` tag, you should get your desired behavior, and that should be reliable across all browsers. Moreover, if you're using `<base>` for only your script tags, LABjs' configuration makes `<base>` unnecessary. :)\n"

        "body": "Unfortunately, this is not really directly possible, cross-browser, at least by the LABjs library. The problem is, browsers are inconsistent about how they handle a \"failed to load\" script. Some fire an error, some never fire anything, some fire a load under certain network error conditions (older browsers I believe).\n\nSo, LABjs really cannot tell if it _didn't_ load, only if it _did_ successfully load.\n\nThe assumption with the normal use of LABjs is that you do not want other code to run if previous code fails to run, as this is **usually** a bad idea, and will just cause cascading errors.\n\nSince you're in an exception case, you'll need to do something different, manually.\n\nMy suggestion is to use a timeout interval, perhaps like this:\n\n``` js\n(function(){\n   var flagged = false;\n   var timer = setTimeout(loadCSLibrary, 10000); // give it 10 secs max to load\n\n   $LAB\n   .script(\"https://.....wa_config.js\")\n   .wait(function(){\n      loadSCLibrary();\n   });\n\n   function loadSCLibrary(){\n      clearTimeout(timer);\n      timer = null;\n      if (!flagged) {\n         flagged = true; // mark this code as having run already\n\n         // ... your code\n\n      }   \n   }\n})();\n```\n\nHopefully that kind of helps illustrate how to construct a timeout for your scenario. :)\n"

        "body": "Thanks for such a rapid response Kyle.\n\nI\u2019m afraid setting location.href doesn\u2019t work because it effectively refreshes the page with the contents of whatever is the new value of location.href. Setting it to blank is probably not defined behaviour in the DOM spec \u2013 and in any case causes LAB initialisation to fail because it doesn\u2019t match the RE executed on line 18.\n\nI hadn\u2019t RTFM properly so I didn\u2019t see the BasePath variable. I expect that will work once LAB is loaded, but LAB won\u2019t load unless the RE in line 18 returns a match.\n\nI fear this can\u2019t be made to work with the present sources. A fix might be to attempt to match the RE and if that fails then to look at any <base> element present before giving up. The code would need quite significant change I think because the chain of variable definitions needs to be broken. Depends how important you feel this issue is.\n"

        "body": "For security reasons, there doesn't appear to be any way to hijack/override `location` or `location.href`. So that monkey patching won't work.\n\nI'm yet to be convinced that there is a good work-around for URL handling when you're in an iframe that's essentially URL-less. I'm not convinced of what a good clean fall-back is, but I know that `<base>` is not what I'd want.\n\nOne option is if there's no location, then LABjs **doesn't** try to do any URL resolving/canonicalization. This sounds good on the surface, until you realize that LABjs does this only so you get the kind of behavior you expect around \"duplicates\" handling, especially when referencing the same script with different types of relative URLs. Users expect the tool to \"know\" these are the same, and the only way to do that is to resolve them all against a base URL, the window location being the appropriate one.\n\nNot doing canonicalization of the URLs will likely lead to strange gotchas around duplicates, so it is similarly a bad route to head down, IMO.\n\nAnother option is to fake some base URL like \"http://some.tld\" in the case of a missing one, so that all the logic works correctly. But then there's issues where a protocol-relative URL like \"//someother.tld/foo/bar\" URL would expect the correct http vs. https switching, which we really can't do. So this is a bad route.\n\nAnother option is to have LABjs try to look up to a parent frame if the current page has no URL, under the assumption that some frame in the heirarchy in the browser must have a URL. But I'm not sure if security things like CSP would prevent this sort of thing from inside a srcdoc iframe. That would take a lot of research and proving. But it's the only option I see so far which is remotely plausible.\n\n---\n\nThen, we have to step back and ask if benefits of this fix, niche as it is, justifies the \"pain\" of the fix. I'm not really convinced it does. This is the first time in 4-1/2 years someone's asked for it. The stability of LABjs is every bit as important a feature as any other, at this point.\n\nSo I think we could research _if_ there's a fix, but then you'd probably just need to run your own patched version of LABjs with such a fix. If we got a bunch of people asking for this, and if we had other bugs or features that were waiting and could be collected into a compelling enough of a set for a justifiable release, we could consider it some day.\n"

        "body": "I hear what you say and I understand this is an obscure situation. I have a patch that works well for me when I supply a base, so that\u2019s fine. My situation is I generate some information on the client side I want to incorporate in the page coming into the iframe from (my tame) server. This is too bulky to incorporate in the URL for the iframe, and waiting until the iframe DOM is complete to insert it involves changing the server side code and some complex synchronisation issues at the client end. So what I do is generate the page that the server would have generated if it only had the information that I have in the client, and provide that as the srcdoc for the iframe. The only problem is this page needs to be re-based to the server root address so all the resources of the page load correctly. The browsers seem to cope fine with this but LAB.js fails because it needs the location.href.\n\nWriting this it occurs to me that maybe I could insert as the srcdoc some Javascript code that would make a POST request to the server incorporating all the data I want, and using the resulting HTML text to replace its own document. This should then behave in the ordinary manner without needing a base and an unpatched LAB.js should work fine.\n\nAnyway it\u2019s my problem and I really appreciate the time you\u2019ve taken to consider and respond. I submitted the issue in case it was of interest elsewhere and so that hopefully if someone else is affected they will find this dialogue and save some time.\n"

I might make a separate fork branch with slight tweaks that deal with non-standard/unexpected `location` values in a more robust way.\n\nI'm not sure when/if those changes would roll into the main branch and necessitate an update (not sure I think these niche cases justify a 2.0.4 patch release). But at least the separate branch would provide an alternate copy for those who need to use LABjs in those unusual conditions.\n\nI think there will someday be a LAB 2.1 release (or whatever), as over the years several tiny things have been requested.

Method 2 should be thought of as an internal queue. Method 1 is a manual external queue.\n\nHope that helps. :)\n"

What I don't think LABjs should be doing is munging URLs with higher level abstractions like version numbers. To me that still seems like it should be handled by your build process, or your templating engine, or ... etc.\n\n> Trying to do : `$LAB.script_cb = function(path) {return this.script(path + '?v{{last_build_date}}')` will not work\n\nCorrect, it won't, as you provided it, return your wrapper each time, it'll just return the `$LAB` chain.\n\nBut with a little extra work, you should be able to achieve what (I think) you're hoping for:\n\n``` js\nvar $LAB_wrapper = (function(version){\n   var $L = $LAB, publicAPI = {\n      script: function(src) {\n         $L = $L.script(src + \"?v\" + version);\n         return publicAPI;\n      },\n      wait: function() {\n         $L = $L.wait.apply(null,arguments);\n         return publicAPI;\n      }\n   };\n   return publicAPI;\n})(\"{{last_build_date}}\");\n\n// later\n\n$LAB_wrapper.script(\"foo.js\").wait().(\"bar.js\");\n// loads \"foo.js?v1234\" and \"bar.js?v1234\"\n```\n\nHopefully that helps get you on the path you're looking for. :)\n"

It would pretty much mimic the behavior when using `<script>` (i.e. an \"uncaught error\" is thrown, having the option to use `window.onerror` to track it).

        "body": "You should not have errors as a matter of practice in production. If you have errors, you should have a way to find and FIX them, not a way to find and IGNORE them. That's the philosophy applied here. That's why LABjs comes with this optional debug build. Moreover, as explained in the thread above, LABjs' assumption is that by default, developers don't want errors leaking out into the consoles in production.\n\nSo, if you experience issues, either in dev or production, with your loading, swap in the debug LABjs, enable debug mode, and find them. And FIX them. Then swap back to non-debug production LABjs and go home and enjoy your weekend. :)\n\nMoreover, there's a simple fix to this problem which doesn't involve changing your LABjs file nor enabling a mode. It's putting your own `try..catch` error handling (or other robust feature testing!) around any code which, you know, might actually error if something's missing. I would suggest avoiding writing code which can error, and being more robust yourself. But to whatever extent that's not possible, it then becomes your responsibility to do the extra work to use LABjs' debug build to find and fix such errors.\n\nExample: Don't just use `$` assuming it's there, and let an error happen. Test if it's there first:\n\n``` js\nif (typeof $ !== \"undefined\") {\n   $(\"..\")...\n}\nelse {\n   logErrorToServer(\"Oops, jquery is missing.\");\n   ShowPoliteErrorMessageToUser();\n}\n```\n\n**Note:** I don't recommend running with the debug build of LABjs in production, even with the debug mode turned off. But, it's not much bigger, nor appreciably slower (same `try..catch`s in place regardless), so it might be your chosen option to always run with the debug build of LABjs in production, and then all you have to do to \"see\" the errors is turn debug mode on (no file switching necessary).\n"

So, if we're going to make the change to one regex, we have to change both regexes.\n\nBut, imagine if we did that, and then someone had this URL: `foo:bar/baz.js` to load some script, while inside a chrome extension.\n\nAny generic regex that matches your chrome-extension URL would have to also match that `foo:bar..` URL. However, that URL might in fact be intended as a relative URL, where they want it to be canonicalized to the root chrome-extension URI, so that it would be loaded as `chrome-extension:aosnsldk24rl2ksada/foo:bar/baz.js`.\n\nHow could we know that this URL should have been taken to be as absolute instead: `foo:bar/baz.js`, rather than relative?\n\nWe couldn't. Right now, \"absolute\" requires something like `http://` at the beginning, which is an easy assumption. But that assumption would totally go away with the proposed change.\n\nUnless, and this is the part I'm dubious on, the regex only allowed a specific safe-list of scheme names, not just a `w+` type regex match... like `chrome-extension:`, `about:`, etc.\n\nHow would we decide which scheme names should be explicitly listed? What happens if someone later comes along and says, \"hey, my page is running under this `wxyz:..` scheme, can you whitelist it?\" And what happens if that accidentally collides with someone else's relative URL design?\n\nSeems like a future maintenance nightmare, that ensures we have to keep updating LABjs rather than keeping it stable and unchanging as much as possible, and that we're asking for breakages.\n\nNot sure what a good general solution to this would be.\n\nMy initial reaction is similar to what I said in #93, which is that this is a case where you should tweak LABjs for your own needs, since it's a pretty niche use-case, and the pain (of this one specifically) is disproportionately high.\n"

        "body": "Sorry if I'm not nicer in the following lines, it's late and I'm tired so I'll try go straight to the point(s).\n\n> You should not have errors as a matter of practice in production. If you have errors, you should have a way to find and FIX them, not a way to find and IGNORE them. That's the philosophy applied here. That's why LABjs comes with this optional debug build. Moreover, as explained in the thread above, LABjs' assumption is that by default, developers don't want errors leaking out into the consoles in production.\n\nI must have expressed very bad if you understood I'm trying to hide any error, cause my goal it's exactly the opposite.\n\nI'm not going to argue whether hiding errors is what you want to do by default (but probably you're already guessing I think this is just a bad programming practice). But please, tell me, how I'm supposed to know whether I'm having errors in production if queueWait() is hiding them? As said before, am I supposed to run LABjs in debug mode in production the whole time in order to achieve this?\n\n> Moreover, there's a simple fix to this problem which doesn't involve changing your LABjs file nor enabling a mode. It's putting your own try..catch error handling (or other robust feature testing!) around any code which, you know, might actually error if something's missing. I would suggest avoiding writing code which can error, and being more robust yourself. But to whatever extent that's not possible, it then becomes your responsibility to do the extra work to use LABjs' debug build to find and fix such errors.\n\nThanks for recommending me to don't write faulty code, it's something I already try to do, but not even with all the tests in the world one can avoid sh*t happening in unpredictable ways with any of the millions of users we currently have.\n\nRegarding to your suggestion of using try/catch, currently I'm working in monkey patching LABjs in the following way:\n\n``` js\n(function() {\n  var originalQueueWait = $LAB.queueWait;\n  $LAB.queueWait = function(callback) {\n    return originalQueueWait.call($LAB, function() {\n      try {\n        callback();\n      } catch (error) {\n        setTimeout(function() { throw error; }, 0);\n      }\n    });\n  };\n})();\n```\n\n> Example: Don't just use $ assuming it's there, and let an error happen. Test if it's there first:\n\nI really hope I'll never have to write such a defensive code! Compare it to the following (considering LABjs whould be throwing the errors):\n\n``` js\nonerror = function(message, file, line, column, error) {\n  logErrorToServer(error && error.message || error || message);\n  ShowPoliteErrorMessageToUser();\n};\n```\n\nI'm not saying this is the best approach for any given case but this would act as a good enough safety net for 99% of the cases.\n\n> I would remind you, you should avoid having very much code in .wait(..) callbacks. If it's more than a few lines here or there, you should consider moving that code into its own file, where the \"error handling\" (aka suppression) that LABjs does won't hurt you. Then you'll only have a few .wait(..) lines to worry about with errors and debug modes and builds and such.\n\nPlease, consider this example:\n\n``` js\n$LAB.script('main.js').wait(function() {\n  someFunctionInMainJs();\n});\n```\n\nEven in this minimalistic `wait()` callback thousands of instructions can be executed because of it, so I'm afraid I can't just \"avoid having much code in it\".\n\nAnd now I see you're proposing to move my code to its own file a new question comes to my mind. Why such a different error handling between `script()` and `wait()`?\n\nHope I've been clearer this time!\n"

        "body": "First, I'd suggest reading [this thread #57](https://github.com/getify/LABjs/issues/57), specifically these two comments, for more back-story on my reasoning: [comment 1](https://github.com/getify/LABjs/issues/57#issuecomment-5054895)  [comment 2](https://github.com/getify/LABjs/issues/57#issuecomment-5055481)\n\n> if `queueWait()` is hiding them?\n\nI am not \"hiding them\", I am preventing them from affecting the rest of the `queueWait()`s which might come later in the chain.\n\nSince LABjs is driven by code, it has to be more sensitive to the fact that errors in user code could stop LABjs itself from doing the rest of its job.\n\nBy contrast, in native browser behavior, errors in one `<script>` element cannot stop other `<script>` elements from running (it just abandons execution of the first one and moves on).\n\nIf LABjs didn't catch the errors, any error thrown would cause the rest of the **LABjs controlled parts of the chain** to stop working. But, quite confusingly, the actual script load-and-run behavior (which the browser handles) would NOT be stopped, so some of the chain (`script()`s) would continue and some of the chain (`wait()`s) would not.\n\nTHAT kind of behavior would be far worse.\n\nI'm attempting to keep LABjs working as much like the native browser behavior as possible, with the least amount of surprise of possible. I know you think the current \"hiding errors\" behavior is surprising, but the other choice would be much more surprising. \n\nLet me illustrate. Let's take this series of markup:\n\n``` html\n<script src=\"script1.js\"></script>\n<script>\n   doSomethingInScript1(); // let's say this throws an error!\n</script>\n<script src=\"script2.js\"></script>\n<script>\n   doSomethingForScript3(); // no errors here!\n</script>\n<!-- requires `doSomethingForScript3()` to have completed successfully first! -->\n<script src=\"script3.js\"></script>\n```\n\nOK, so in normal browser behavior, `script1.js` loads and runs, then it tries to run the next inline `<script>` block, which throws an error. Then, `script2.js` runs, then the next inline `<script>` block runs (no errors), then `script3.js` runs.\n\nBut, hypothetically, what if the browser did this instead:\n\n`script1.js` loads and runs, then the first inline `<script>` block runs, which throws an error. Next, `script2.js` still loads and runs fine, but then the next inline `<script>` block **is never going to even be attempted**, because of the previous error. Lastly, `script3.js` loads, and tries to run, but since `doSomethingForScript3()` never even tried to run, now tons of errors in `script3.js` are going to spam your error logs.\n\nThink about that scenario for a moment. Is that scenario more or less surprising than the current native behavior (which you could describe as \"run as much of this stuff as you can\")?\n\nI'd say unequivocally that the current behavior is much better than this second hypothetical scenario.\n\n**That hypothetical scenario** is exactly what would happen if LABjs didn't catch-and-swallow errors inside of `wait()`. :(\n\nHopefully, that fully explains why we can't just let the errors be thrown.\n\n---\n\nNow, I bet the next thing you're wondering is, \"can't you just catch any errors but dump them all to the error log?\" Of course I can. That's what the debug build and debug mode is for!\n\nWhy didn't I just make the core do that? Because philosophically, I believe devs don't want, by default, to have errors that occur in production spamming the console logs of millions of users' browsers. By default, the production build of LABjs tries to be silent, while the debug build tries to be very chatty.\n\nYou have to specifically choose to do one of these things to opt into such verbose reporting:\n1. use the debug build and `DEBUG` mode of LABjs\n2. put your own `try..catch` around your inline `wait(..)` code that dumps errors yourself\n\nEither way, you are specifically saying, \"I want to see production errors\". I would hope you only do that when troubleshooting a problem, and not **all the time**, but even if you do it **all the time**, then it's you that had to opt-in to that, rather than having to opt-out.\n\nI call that [\"pit of success\"](http://blog.codinghorror.com/falling-into-the-pit-of-success/) rather than \"pit of failure\".\n\n---\n\nLastly...\n\n> how I'm supposed to know whether I'm having errors in production\n\nThis is a very important dev-ops type of question, but it's vastly more complicated than anything LABjs even remotely tries to tackle.\n\nYou'll note that just dumping stuff into the console of your users isn't telling you if you're having problems in production. If the kinds of problems you're trying to find are anything like the kinds I've run into, they don't happen for everyone, only some. So, you can't just rely on seeing the messages in **your console** when you run the production app.\n\nOdds are you're going to need to have a robust production monitoring solution in place. Perhaps something which sees if any JS errors happen and remotely logs those to your server logs.\n\nIf what happens by the error being swallowed is that some part of your app fails to get initialized, but the rest of it gets loaded, one thing that may occur is that other cascading errors will happen later when users click certain buttons (which your production monitoring would catch).\n\nAnother thing that could happen is that the error remains \"silent\". That is, most or all users don't even notice, or if they do, it's not a big enough deal that they care or complain.\n\nIf _that_ is the kind of error you're worried about missing, because you don't even know it's happening, stop and ask yourself, \"why am I so worried?\" If an error occurs, but no one notices, and it doesn't cause any other breakage, what is the big deal, and more importantly, why would dumping that into an error console help identify it?\n\n**I think the more likely scenario is** that you WILL hear about errors, through user complaints, or through your production monitoring solutions, or some other channel, and **THEN** you will know it's time to go (temporarily) flip on the debug mode of LABjs in production to start narrowing it down.\n\n**Bottom line: I doubt there really are that many \"hidden silent errors\" in production, when it comes down to real world scenarios playing out.**\n\nI'm sure I haven't convinced you, but hopefully this narrative helps explain more completely where my philosophy is coming from.\n"

Using a relative URL would point the resource to `/js/file.js` which resolves to `salesforce.com/js/file.js` which Salesforce then redirects to `visual.force.com/js/file.js`. It appears that on a redirect IE 9 and 10 load the resource enough to cache it, but not enough to execute it. Thanks!\n"

So there's nothing to change in LABjs for that.\n\nIt remains an unknown to me how to tell the browser (if anything) that you want requests to be interleaved on a single connection. I believe that may happen automatically, but I suppose it's possible it may need a client-side change. I've not heard any details about that. It's also possible that it requires no extra work on the client, but may require changes to the server to recognize these requests and combine the responses into one connection. Again, I have not investigated any of these specific details.\n\nIf there ends up being something specific LABjs would need to change to adopt HTTP2 conventions for parallelism of connections, I'm happy to entertain discussion.\n"

We can't really just use an existing virtual/mock DOM for this purpose, because we need to actually control it (what APIs are present, how they behave, etc) for our different test simulations.\r\n\r\n   - affected DOM APIs / properties:\r\n      - `getElementsByTagName(..)`\r\n      - `createElement(..)`\r\n      - `head`\r\n      - `appendChild(..)`\r\n      - `removeChild(..)`\r\n      - `baseURI`\r\n      - `setAttribute(..)`\r\n      - `getAttribute(..)`\r\n      - `addEventListener(..)`\r\n      - `removeEventListener(..)`\r\n      - `relList`\r\n      - `supports(..)`\r\n      - `performance.getEntriesByName(..)`\r\n   - we need to be able to simulate a variety of different browser environment scenarios by changing the behavior of these APIs, for example:\r\n      - preloading vs no-preloading\r\n      - script ordered-async vs not\r\n      - `<link rel=preload>` tags already present in the page vs not\r\n      - \"random\" server/network timing variations (and errors!)\r\n- [ ] rebuild the docs\r\n- [ ] revisit feature requests from the last N number of years of issue threads, examine feasibility\r\n- [ ] explore Debug mode and what that means for 3.0+ -- is there a debug build with extra code, what changes in debug mode, etc?\r\n- [ ] explore replacing `canonicalURL(..)` with [`URL(..)`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/URL), probably with some sort of polyfill-fallback (for older browsers)\r\n- [ ] change the usages of timers (`setTimeout(..)`) to a scheduling queue (like [this one](https://github.com/getify/asynquence/blob/master/asq.src.js#L19-L59)), backed by one of these async timing mechanisms (in order of precedence): [`requestIdleCallback(..)`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/requestIdleCallback), [`setImmediate(..)`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/setImmediate), [`process.nextTick(..)`](https://nodejs.org/api/process.html#process_process_nexttick_callback_args), or [`setTimeout(..)`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WindowOrWorkerGlobalScope/setTimeout)\r\n- [ ] using [getify/ScanTree](https://github.com/getify/ScanTree), build a server-side LABjs utility that can scan a code base and compile a list of resources to be loaded, and produce not only the `$LAB` code chain to load it, but also produce the `<link rel=preload>` markup to inject into an HTML page to start the preloading early (parser stage)\r\n\r\n   NOTE: this utility needs to (eventually) be able to parse ES6 modules `import` syntax as well, something that ScanTree doesn't currently support. That may mean needing to extend ScanTree in some way."

        "body": "> These false assumptions are those of the angular code here, not my own code.\r\n\r\nI didn't mean to suggest it was your fault or poor assumptions. The fault is with tools that make these decisions, always has been and always will be. :)\r\n\r\nMoreover, these bad assumptions make those tools unfriendly to **any** dynamic resource loader, even a manual inline snippet inside a `<script>` tag. Dynamic resource loading, which has been a thing for a really long time, is antithetical to these assumptions. It's similar to tools that rely on `document.write(..)`. I've literally had such tools just tell their users \"don't dynamically load\".\r\n\r\n> It's a jquery event (it's not the same as window.onload, and is not a real DOM event as far as I am aware; it has its own characteristics in its attempts to be cross-browser and support its assumptions)\r\n\r\nAre you talking about `$.ready(..)` here? I'm assuming so. \"DOM ready\" is otherwise known as [\"DOMContentLoaded\"](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Events/DOMContentLoaded)  and is absolutely a real DOM event thing. All `$.ready(..)` does is provide a dedicated event handler interface for it.\r\n\r\nAnd BTW, jquery's `$.ready(..)` is patched (as of jQuery 1.4 years ago) to handle the use case where jQuery itself is dynamically loaded after DOMContentLoaded has already passed. What jQuery does (or at least used to do, I haven't looked at their source code in half a decade) is check the [`document.readyState`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Document/readyState) property (again, totally standard DOM stuff) to check to see if the document load has already occurred. If so, jQuery always fires your `$.ready(..)` right away.\r\n\r\nBut all of this is actually orthogonal to your problem. The problem is not whether `$.ready(..)` works or not. In fact, `$.holdReady(..)` is not fixing anything \"broken\" about `$.ready(..)`. It's making `$.ready(..)` work in an entirely different way than it was designed, because the authors of these frameworks/tools insist on using it differently. But DOM-ready has worked -- as designed -- for a really, really long time.\r\n\r\nIn fact, the proof that it \"works\" is that it's firing for you, even though it's firing \"too early\". The separate problem is that this event will, in general, ***always be able to fire before resources*** that don't *block* the event -- any dynamically loaded resource, any resource that `defer`s its loading (like `<script defer>`, etc), and more -- has finished loading.\r\n\r\nIf a resource doesn't block the event, obviously there's a race condition.\r\n\r\n> as its name tells us, its intention was to signal that code running then can expect everything to have loaded\r\n\r\nEh, no. Though the name `DOMContentLoaded` says \"Content\", the \"content\" here isn't about external resources. It's about the internal DOM element structure. And \"Loaded\" means the HTML itself has loaded and been parsed into those DOM element objects.\r\n\r\nQuoting [the MDN page](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Events/DOMContentLoaded):\r\n\r\n>> The DOMContentLoaded event is fired when the initial HTML document has been completely loaded and parsed, without waiting for stylesheets, images, and subframes to finish loading. A very different event `load` should be used only to detect a fully-loaded page.\r\n\r\nSo `document.ready` is definitely not about \"resources have finished loading.\" `window.onload` was originally meant for resource loading completion, even though it also won't wait for (some kinds of) dynamically loaded resources.\r\n\r\nThe crux of the mal-assumption around `DOMContentLoaded` has always been related to `<script>` elements. Because `document.write(..)` needs to run synchronously, the browser has always ensured that any `<script src=..>` or `<script>..</script>` element would execute (regardless of loading order) in the **same order as listed in the DOM**.\r\n\r\nThus, the logical reasoning goes: \"if the current line of code is executing, then any other code that was 'requested' (listed in the DOM) earlier *must* already have finished loading **AND EXECUTING**.\" From that, it's a natural extension to assume, \"if i declare a DOM-ready handler in a piece of code, then all the code -- at least the code 'before' me -- must already have loaded and run, because I couldn't have gotten to this line of code if that previous code hadn't already run.\"\r\n\r\nLong before resource loaders came around, this assumption was already broken when HTML added `<script async>` and `<script defer>`. In both those cases, you're telling the browser to take that script resource and treat it as a separate thing that doesn't hold to those rules. So it's really always been a terrible assumption and conflation, but resource loaders painfully expose it for what it is: **junk science**.\r\n\r\n> $.holdReady() is a jquery tool to manipulate the $(document).ready event\r\n\r\nYour bug may just be that this plugin is broken or incomplete. I don't know.\r\n\r\nBut in theory, if it lets you \"hold off and artificially fire jquery's `ready` event whenever\" you want, then you should be able to \"delay\" until the final `.wait(..)` in your `$LAB` chain. That may be what you were trying to do, not sure, but at least in theory it seems reasonable. Well... hacky patchy ill-advised... but not irrational.\r\n\r\nNow that I think about it... if `$.holdReady` is a jQuery plugin -- it modifies jQuery at run time -- the race condition could just be that jQuery is firing its ready event before `$.holdReady` has a chance to modify jQuery to hold the event off. It could be that you need to package jQuery and `$.holdReady` in the same file so they're ensured to run together. I dunno.\r\n\r\nI still really feel like this is a bug that has nothing to do with LABjs, but more about the process of resource loading in general, and perhaps a failure to hack things to work differently than designed.\r\n\r\nIOW, I'm pretty sure I could expose this bug without using LABjs at all, just using basic resource loading logic.\r\n\r\n---------\r\n\r\nAny chance you could pull out the part of angular that is creating the problem (I guess along with `$.holdReady(..)`) and show a standalone minimal reproduce test case that I could analyze, instead of needing to grok all of angular's internals?"

I can't tell for sure, and it seems like that might not be true (iframe technically enabled a crude form of ajax back in '98, even if ajax as we know it today wasn't around until gmail came out, really), but it was around before the async script attribute (2010?) was for sure. (can't tell exactly when DOMContentLoaded, but it was in v 1.0 of ff... but [Wikipedia says it was unofficial before HTML5](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DOM_events#Other_events), which is interesting.) Mypoint is that my guess had been that the spec writers didn't think about the possibility of async JS code modifying the DOM, or that that wasn't possible yet, but I now think I'm probably mistaken in that belief.\r\n\r\nThis is what I meant by saying \"ready\" was \"broken\", but if you instead postulate it was correctly defined all along, then yes, it's just its widespread use that is broken.\r\n\r\n...though at that point one has to wonder whether something that is so widely misunderstood has an inherent flaw, no? I adhere to your principles of 'code is written for humans first', shouldn't this really be called DOMResourcesExecuted or something that makes it a bit more clear, since one can never know if the DOM is actually \"Loaded\" (semi-ambiguous word that carries a sense of synchronous finality within an async environment)?\r\n\r\nAnyways, I'm fascinated by discussions like this, but I don't mean to waste your time. It's been an enlightening digression for me.\r\n\r\n> I've literally had such tools just tell their users \"don't dynamically load\".\r\n\r\nYeah, that seems to basically be the case with Angular here. All they would have to do is have their stuff execute on a given event, and tell users to fire that event when ready.\r\n\r\n> But in theory, if it lets you \"hold off and artificially fire jquery's ready event whenever\" you want, then you should be able to \"delay\" until the final .wait(..) in your $LAB chain. That may be what you were trying to do, not sure, but at least in theory it seems reasonable. Well... hacky patchy ill-advised... but not irrational.\r\n\r\nThat's exactly what I was doing, indeed. Agreed somewhat hacky, intercepting the jquery.ready event, which is why I referred to it as a \"patch attempt\"... though, to be fair, jquery supports it itself, and jquery.ready is their own API. Though, to be fairer still, shit doesn't work right now, probably because it's all hacky.\r\n\r\n> But in theory, if it lets you \"hold off and artificially fire jquery's ready event whenever\" you want, then you should be able to \"delay\" until the final .wait(..) in your $LAB chain. That may be what you were trying to do, not sure, but at least in theory it seems reasonable. Well... hacky patchy ill-advised... but not irrational.\r\n\r\nI was able to produce this bug even though I was putting the script tag for jquery at the top of my head, and an onload=\"$.holdReady(true)\" attr for it. I read in a couple places (but did not see it mentioned on MDN's documentation for <script>...) that script tags in the header are async by default, ~~so I moved it to the body, but saw the same issue, unfortunately, no difference~~ <-- I was accidentally loading jquery twice from moving things around during that experiment, whoops. That does seem to have potentially made a difference, and that seems like pretty poor design upon that discovery; I wouldn't expect async=true default in one place and async=false in another. Alas, I'm sure that was likely a part of things, I'll experiment more and report in the next comment rather than pollute this with edits.\r\n\r\n\r\nHere's the angular code bits:\r\n\r\n```\r\n  if (window.angular.bootstrap) {\r\n    //AngularJS is already loaded, so we can return here...\r\n    console.log('WARNING: Tried to load angular more than once.');\r\n    return;\r\n  }\r\n  //try to bind to jquery now so that one can write angular.element().read()\r\n  //but we will rebind on bootstrap again.\r\n  bindJQuery();\r\n\r\n  publishExternalAPI(angular);\r\n\r\n  jqLite(document).ready(function() {\r\n    angularInit(document, bootstrap);\r\n   // this eventually fails because it expects things like angular.module(\"appname\").controller('controllerName') to have been called by this point.\r\n  });\r\n```\r\n```\r\nfunction bindJQuery() {\r\n  // bind to jQuery if present;\r\n  jQuery = window.jQuery;\r\n  // Use jQuery if it exists with proper functionality, otherwise default to us.\r\n  // Angular 1.2+ requires jQuery 1.7.1+ for on()/off() support.\r\n  if (jQuery && jQuery.fn.on) {\r\n    jqLite = jQuery;\r\n    extend(jQuery.fn, {\r\n      scope: JQLitePrototype.scope,\r\n      isolateScope: JQLitePrototype.isolateScope,\r\n      controller: JQLitePrototype.controller,\r\n      injector: JQLitePrototype.injector,\r\n      inheritedData: JQLitePrototype.inheritedData\r\n    });\r\n    // Method signature:\r\n    //     jqLitePatchJQueryRemove(name, dispatchThis, filterElems, getterIfNoArguments)\r\n    jqLitePatchJQueryRemove('remove', true, true, false);\r\n    jqLitePatchJQueryRemove('empty', false, false, false);\r\n    jqLitePatchJQueryRemove('html', false, false, true);\r\n  } else {\r\n    jqLite = JQLite;\r\n  }\r\n  angular.element = jqLite;\r\n}\r\n```\r\nThe bind seems to work, and angular seems to use it, because in the console `angular.element === $` yields `true`, and `$().jquery` yields `2.2.4` (the version I specify in my script, which wouldn't correspond to jqLite).\r\n\r\nBy the way, perusing the source of LABjs, I ran into this at the bottom... any thoughts on this coming into play, potentially?\r\n\r\n```\r\n/* The following \"hack\" was suggested by Andrea Giammarchi and adapted from: http://webreflection.blogspot.com/2009/11/195-chars-to-help-lazy-loading.\r\nNOTE: this hack only operates in FF and then only in versions where document.readyState is not present (FF < 3.6?).\r\n\t   \r\nThe hack essentially \"patches\" the **page** that LABjs is loaded onto so that it has a proper conforming document.readyState, so that if a script which does \r\nproper and safe dom-ready detection is loaded onto a page, after dom-ready has passed, it will still be able to detect this state, by inspecting the now hacked \r\ndocument.readyState property. The loaded script in question can then immediately trigger any queued code executions that were waiting for the DOM to be ready. \r\nFor instance, jQuery 1.4+ has been patched to take advantage of document.readyState, which is enabled by this hack. But 1.3.2 and before are **not** safe or \r\nfixed by this hack, and should therefore **not** be lazy-loaded by script loader tools such as LABjs.\r\n*/ \r\n\t(function(addEvent,domLoaded,handler){\r\n\t\tif (document.readyState == null && document[addEvent]){\r\n\t\t\tdocument.readyState = \"loading\";\r\n\t\t\tdocument[addEvent](domLoaded,handler = function(){\r\n\t\t\t\tdocument.removeEventListener(domLoaded,handler,false);\r\n\t\t\t\tdocument.readyState = \"complete\";\r\n\t\t\t},false);\r\n\t\t}\r\n\t})(\"addEventListener\",\"DOMContentLoaded\");\r\n\r\n```"

For example, scripts that are before stylesheets or in order one after another (script, stylesheet, script, stylesheet) negatively impact the reports from these tools. It's very annoying but could be stopped by injecting scripts at the end of the `<body>` and stylesheets at the end of the `<head>`."
