I needed and planned to work on something very similar mostly on the form validation part, as far as I saw you made it just like I would do so why re-doing it :-)\nSo, if you have plans/roadmap for the 1.5, count me in and tell me more ;-)\n\nCheers\n"

        "body": "1. helping out\n   This is extremley cool. I will write something about this. \n\nI count you in!!! :-)\n1. Placeholder\n   Technically it is possible, but it's not really my intention/suggestion. webshims feature are already balanced in filesize-/feature. And the placeholder is looked as a module of the form feature. The best way is to add a new polyfill, pointing to the old polyfill:\n   \n   ```\n   //add a new feature called formplaceholder\n   $.webshims.addPolyfill('formplaceholder', {\n           //point the implementation source to the standard placeholder-feature\n           src: 'form-placeholder',\n           //load this polyfill, if placeholder is not supported and the standard placeholder is not loaded\n           test: function(list){\n                return ($.inArray('form-placeholder', list) != -1 || Modernizr.input.placeholder);\n           },\n           //load dom-extend, if needed\n           dependencies: ['dom-extend']\n   });\n   //load only placeholder with dependendcies\n   $.webshims.polyfill('formplaceholder');\n   ```\n\nNote: The new polyfill 'formplaceholder' will still get his configuration from the 'forms-feature'. If you want to change the configuration for the placeholder. Currently only one config-option (use overlabel for all inputs), you have to set the options for the forms - feature:\n\n```\n$.webshims.setOptions('forms', {\n    placeholderType: 'over'\n});\n```\n"
    },

The web site I'm developing needs to be optimized for people all over the world, especially those with little or no access to modern browsers and fast networks.\n\nIf webshims lib gets enough uptake, it could be hosted on Microsoft's or Google's CDNs, which have measures in place against DOS attacks. In the meantime, any developers concerned about vulnerability could just choose not to use the feature.\n\nI'd vote for this to be a core feature, but defer to further community discussion as necessary.\n\nThanks for listening. =)\n"

        "body": "Ok, before I start to fix the issues here some short informations, how it should work:\n1. the customMessage approach (has a minor error see workaround below):\n       $.webshims.setOptions('forms', {customMessages: true});\n       $.webshims.activeLang('zh');  \n       $.webshims.polyfill('forms');\n       $(document).bind('firstinvalid', function(e){\n           $.webshims.validityAlert.showFor( e.target, $(e.target).attr('customValidationMessage'));\n           return false;\n       });\n2. the overrideMessages approach:\n       $.webshims.setOptions('forms', {overrideMessages: true});\n       $.webshims.activeLang('zh');  \n       $.webshims.polyfill('forms');\n\nDue to the fact, that I have moved activeLang from polyfiller.js to dom-extend.js, both approaches will throw an error. The second approach currently only works initially, what is not nice.\n\nHere is how you would do it, with webshims lib 1.5.2:\n        $.webshims.setOptions('forms', {customMessages: true});\n        $.webshims.ready('dom-extend', function(){\n            $.webshims.activeLang('zh');  \n        });\n        $.webshims.polyfill('forms');\n        $(document).bind('firstinvalid', function(e){\n            $.webshims.validityAlert.showFor( e.target, $(e.target).attr('customValidationMessage') );\n            return false;\n        });\n\nTo make the validityMessages bullet proof, you should write something like this:\n        $.webshims.validityMessages.zh = $.extend(true, {}, $.webshims.validityMessages[''], {\n            valueMissing: '\u8bf7\u586b\u5199\u6b64\u5b57\u6bb5\u3002'\n            ,typeMismatch: {\n                email: '\u8bf7\u8f93\u5165\u4e00\u4e2a\u7535\u5b50\u90ae\u4ef6\u5730\u5740\u3002'\n            }\n        });\n\nAdditionally, I see some other problems in your code, regarding to $('body').fadeIn(); Am I right, that you are doing this, to remove FOUCs?\n"

I've upgraded to webshims 1.6.0RC3 and incorporated your suggestions [commit](https://github.com/jab/bravenewsoftware.org/commit/1a6f41fa2853debf3c134aaa1f7236dc1b38cfa8). Things are looking much better now all around, except for one small thing I noticed: In Firefox 4, the form is validated before anything is input, so basically it starts out with the email input outlined in red ([example](http://1.bravenewsoftware.appspot.com/)). I can dig into this when I get a chance but feel free to close this ticket in the meantime.\n\nThanks again!\n\nJosh\n"

This is a feature of [CSS3 UI module](http://www.w3.org/TR/css3-ui/#pseudo-invalid) and doesn't have to do with webshims lib. You can simply remove this with box-shadow: none. Note that you should also set the border, the background-color and the color. Here is how you could do it:\n        /\\* remove native invalid styles */\n        :invalid {\n            box-shadow: none;\n            border: 1px solid #000;\n            background: #fff;\n            color: #000;\n        }\n\nFF4 adds some nice extra selector, which do the job better this is called: [:-moz-ui-invalid](https://developer.mozilla.org/en/CSS/%3A-moz-ui-invalid). Webshims also adds some extra class, which behave similiar to -moz-ui-invalid (.form-ui-invalid).\n\nSo your style could look, like this:\n        /\\* remove native invalid styles */\n        :invalid {\n            box-shadow: none;\n            border: 1px solid #000;\n            background: #fff;\n            color: #000;\n        }\n\n```\n    //add invalid style for FF4\n    :-moz-ui-invalid {\n        //invalid style\n    }\n\n    //add invalid style for all browsers\n    :-moz-ui-invalid {\n        //invalid style\n    }\n```\n"

        "body": "About the $('body').fadeIn()-Thing:\n\nYou do move your JS at the bottom. Moving JS at the bottom doesn't make loading the whole page faster. Putting JS at the bottom means: Load JS as slow as possible, to reduce the time, where the user doesn't see the page loading (white page). The problem is, that this also causes FOUCs. In your case you hide the whole page and make it visible with JS, which means, the white page loading isn't decreased, it will be increased. This means: You should, put your JS at the top!\n\nAnother thing here is:\n1. Don't rely on JS\n2. Don't hide with display: none (because, this can create some strange issues, if you are using JS)\n\nMy CSS-Code for this (The .js-Class comes with Modernizr):\n\n```\n    .js body {\n        visibility: hidden;\n    }\n```\n\nMy suggested JS Code:\n\n```\n    $(function(){\n        $('body')\n            .css({opacity: 0, visibility: 'visible'})\n            .fadeTo(400, 1)\n        ;\n    });\n```\n\nOne question: I have written, that a developer should prefer 'customMessages' over 'overrideMessages', why did you use overrideMessage? (As you see I'm not really happy with this.)\n"

It was a small issue on a browser with very small marketshare and I take x-browser testing very seriously.\n\nThis was the list of browsers, which I did actively test:\n- FF final/latest (4.0)\n- FF -1 (3.6)\n- FF fixed @ 3.0 (no localStorage in Mozilla test)\n- IE6\n- IE7\n- IE8\n- IE9\n- Safari - 1 (4.x)\n- Safari final/latest (5.0.4)\n- Safari for latest iOS (4.3.1)\n- Safari nightly\n- Chrome dev (currently 11)\n- Chrome final (10)\n- Chrome fixed @ 10 (has almost everything right, but one small issue, which has to be browser sniffed)\n- Opera final (11.01)\n- Opera -1 (10.54)\n\nand now I got a new browser to test with each release:\n- Safari fixed to 5.0.1\n\nAlthough, I'm working with a testsuite, this huge list makes it really hard to push a new release.\n"

I just noticed it says very clearly on the [demo page](http://afarkas.github.com/webshim/demos/index.html) that Chrome 9.0+ is supported, so a bug submitted for Chrome 7 can very fairly be closed as invalid!\n\nIn other news, I haven't yet had a chance to put any more time into looking into the validation being triggered too early in Firefox 4 or the customMessages vs overrideMessages. Probably any extra time I get to put into webshims in the future will go toward helping with translations and looking at using Modernizr 2's ability to just test for the features you need. Ideally some day there'd just be a webshims API hosted on a CDN which you could use to only request script that tests for and polyfills just the features you need. That would be awesome!\n"

All polyfills which try to do this are not save to use.\n\nAlso Note, that you can \"implement\" customValidationMessages. With the following lines:\n\n```\n$.webshims.setOptions('forms', { customMessages: true });\n$.webshims.polyfill('forms');\n```\n\nAnd then use:\n\n```\n<input data-errormessage=\"errormessage\" type=\"email\" />\n\n$(elem).attr('customValidationMessage');\n```\n\nThere are a lot ways to manipulate the errormessages. You find more information in documentation [here](http://afarkas.github.com/webshim/demos/demos/webforms.html#custom-error) and [here](http://afarkas.github.com/webshim/demos/demos/webforms/1-webforms-lang-custom-bubble.html)\n"

Webshims lib can not fix this. There are only two workarounds:\n1. remove the CSS, which triggers the bug (position: relative on body in your case).\n2. replace the native validation ui, with the your own or with webshims build in validation ui (last should be the easiest way)\n\nbut I'm pretty sure tkent will fix this issue, before the bug goes into the beta/final branch.\n"

Am I doing it wrong?\n\nThanks.\n"

I will observe this in the beta channel and if it's still there, I will file a bug.\n\nAbout the message \"Polyfilling takes a little bit long\". This message comes, if polyfilling takes more than 600ms. I have changed this message from \"warn\" to \"info\", so that it should be only visible, if you do set $.webshims.debug = true;. \n\nIf this message comes only if this error occurs, than everything should be fine. If it's comming in Chrome 14 or FF7 and you are only loading the \"forms\" feature, you really should look into the networkpanel to detect why it takes so much time.\n\nYou can also give me the URL to look into this.\n\ncheers\nAlex\n"

In Chrome and Safari the behavior is absolute HTML5 comiplant.\n\nBut there is another possible solution, simply use setCustomValidity to implement customErrors. I have created a demo using [input[type=\"range\"] with setCustomValidity](http://jsfiddle.net/trixta/xTTEy/).\n\nI hope this helps.\n\ncheers\nAlex\n"

There is nothing I can do against it, but this has no side effects.\n\nYou will see this message on a lot of jQuery sites (http://jqueryui.com/themeroller/, http://jquery.com/) . It might be, that this changes with jQuery 1.7 (They have refactored a lot in events and now they do not copy everything, but I'm not sure).\n\ncheers\nalex\n"

Switiching to use CSS (either inside of a stylesheet or inline) to set the dimensions would be an easy solution. In fact using styles will give you more features, like using % or em units. Isn't this a way you could go?\n\ncheers\nAlex\n"

Others may run into similar problems though; it might be nice to document the CSS changes somewhere. For example, if someone is setting video {width: 100%} in their own CSS (not inline), I'm guessing it will be overridden by shims, since it's added dynamically. I'm not sure how adding a body class would make overriding the CSS more difficult... but maybe there's more complexity there I don't understand.\n\nthanks for your help.\n"

There is only one small problem with 1.8.2 and jQuery 1.7 and it's almost theoretic nature:\n\nIf you would delegate a submit event from a form to the same form, the bug would be triggered, but actually this code wouldn't really make sense and wouldn't work neither, so no big problem.\n\nBUT: There is some really bad news for you. webshims 1.7 has a huge issue with upcomming chrome 16. Webshims has fixed it with 1.8.2 (still one minor issue with Chrome 16). If you have time wait for 1.8.3 final, but if you are using webshims in production you should switch soon (either to 1.8.2 or to 1.8.3RC3 <- it is a real RC, so I don't plan to change anything in the final (only updating testsuite, jQuery, Modernizr...).\n"

        "body": "Hi,\n\nI'm not 100% sure, wether I understand your code/purpose right. If I try your demo page without the changes, everything is fine (short test in IE9/FF8). My hole testsuite is testing webshims by calling polyfill after the load event.\n\nI do generate Special 'Ready' events, which are immediately fired, if you [add a new event-listener](https://github.com/mrohland-at-gannett/webshim/blob/master/src/polyfiller.js#L198-200). This special event handler is [created by overriting the normal jQuery ready method](https://github.com/mrohland-at-gannett/webshim/blob/master/src/polyfiller.js#L604-618). \n\nIn case your using polyfill after DOMReady I always suggest to set waitReady option to false, because it doesn't work as expected. -> Webshims doesn't delay the domready method anymore until all features are loaded and implemented. Could you please explain in more detail, what the problem is. If your code doesn't work right (polyfilling after ready-event), you found a bug, because it should already work, but I have difficulties to reproduce this.\n\ncheers and thanks for working on the code :-)\nalex\n"

The demo file I submitted wasn't the correct scenario (I had been testing something else and submitted that by mistake).\n\nThe change I made in polyfiller.js fixes an issue I was having when attempting to dynamically load webshims. Here's what I went through:\n\nTo get the webforms portion of webshim to work I had to follow your instructions on Stack Overflow pertaining to yepnope (http://stackoverflow.com/questions/5433126/html5-modernizr-yepnope-webforms2-issue) to get the library to load without any errors. Of course the \"You should call $.webshims.polyfill before DOM-Ready\" message still appears.\n\nThen the validation polyfills wouldn't appear because .validity-alert-wrapper was still waiting for a DOMReady event, before appending to the body. (line 347 of shim/form-core.js)\n\nThe change I made insures that callbacks in a webshims.ready('DOM') call fire immediately if DOMReady has already occurred. I could have just added my fix just to form-core.js but I figured this would resolve the issue if other shims functioned similarly.\n\nI'm sure you're more intimately aware of any ramifications my change could have so if there's a more elegant solution you can suggest I'm eager to hear it.\n"

        "body": "This would mean an API change, which I do not want to make. I would suggest to add a new event called changedvaliditystate or something similiar. I made a [gist example](https://gist.github.com/1474461).\n\nI'm currently not totally conviced, wether I want to add this. Could you provide some informations?\n\nSome informations about, when I do add something:\n\nWith webshims, I really only want to add HTML5 capabilities. If there are common and usefull extensions, I don't really want to add them anymore, instead I really would like to see a jQuery-plugin, which might work also without webshims and only in  HTML5 capable browsers. This is the reason why I'm currently working on [JME2](https://github.com/aFarkas/jMediaelement/tree/jme2). This project provides some API extensions to the mediaelements and let's you create custom styleable controls for mediaelements using a declarative markup API. It can be used in all modern browsers without a polyfill and if you are using webshims, you can use it in all browsers. So I really want to seperate extensions/abstractions from polyfilling.\n\nOnly extensions/abstractions, which are a) very usefull, b) can be easily implemented into webshims and c) can't be implemented easily outside of webshims are canditates to go directly into webshims.\n\nThere are so much possibilities to create totally new user interfaces and usefull abstracted APIs on top of the Standard API... I really want to see them, but outside of webshims...\n"

        "body": "Your solution is indeed much better than mine - allows for much finer grained event handling!\n\nMy use case is effectively this, given your updated gist version of core-form.js:\n\n```\n<input type=\"email\"><span class=\"error\"></span>\n\n$('form').bind('changedinvalid changedvaliditystate', function(e) {\n  $(e.target).next('.error').html(e.target.validationMessage);\n});\n```\n\nI want that span to always contain the validation message, if any.  Right now, if that field is initially left empty (giving a \"Please fill out this field.\" message in FF), then the user enters something that isn't a valid email address like \"asdfasdfasdf\", which would give the \"Please enter an email address.\" error in FF, without your proposed new \"changedvaliditystate\" event I'd have no way to update the validationMessage.\n\nAlso, I certainly agree with your philosophy of keeping webshims as slim as possible, and that's one of the reasons I like it.  This \"changedvaliditystate\" seems to me like it belongs along next to your existing \"changedinvalid\" event, but of course that's up to you not me!\n\nThanks again for considering this and your speedy response!\n"

The reason for this is that [HTML5 does **not** allow a placeholder on input[type=\"date\"]](http://dev.w3.org/html5/spec/Overview.html#input-type-attr-summary).\n\nBut you are right, not copying things like tabindex is an issue. I'm asking myself, wether I should use a blacklist or a whitelist for copying things. Do you have any suggestions here?\n\nThanks for filling an issue!!!\n"

        "body": "@billsaysthis \n\nThanks for your bug report. I think, this is not an issue. I have created a [simplified jsfiddle for you](http://jsfiddle.net/trixta/dFq3F/). I see multiple problems with your markup:\n- The [data-datepicker configuration](http://afarkas.github.com/webshim/demos/demos/webforms/3-webforms-widgets.html#configure-ui) is only used, if there is no HTML5 attribute for this purpose. In case of minDate/maxDate, there are already min/max attributes.\n- The date type only allows using the following date format YYYY-MM-DD. If you enter a different format, webshims might use it for displaying it to the user, but don't use it for calculating. The field is simply invalid. Webshims trys to localize it to the browsers locale, but you can also set a specific locale, using $.webshims.activeLang.\n- The data-datepicker configuration must be a valid JSON string, which means, that you have to use \" instead of ' inside of your attribute.\n\nThis said your initial markup, should look something like this:\n\n```\n    <input type=\"date\" id=\"mbdrFrom\" value=\"2012-01-05\" min=\"2011-11-18\" max=\"2012-01-05\" />\n```\n\nPlease let me know, wether this helps.\n"

However, I now see your point about only adding that when there's no real label.\n\n## Why is implicit label not recognized\n\nMakes sense.  Thanks!  For now I'm just making sure all my input elements have title attributes to get around this.\n\n## Release/Roadmap\n\nThank you so much, that's fantastic!

        "body": "Hi,\n\nfirst of all many thanks for reporting the issues. This makes webshims lib better :-).\n\ni have created a new changed test (https://gist.github.com/1636569). You are mixing two things in your test:\n1. the customValidity extension (has nothing todo with HTML5 constraint validation)\n2. the webshims lib HTML5 implementation\n\nAbout 1. customValidity:\n\nThis script does not try to make everything feel native and therefore it has some limitations. If a user changes the value or a developer trys to set the value using $.prop or a developer trys to get the validity using $.prop, the customValidity info is updated. This means, if you want to change the value using $.val or you have changed the constraints ( input.attr('data-minlength', '4') ), the customValidity info isn't updated. There is an undocumented feature, to solve this simply trigger the 'refreshCustomValidityRules' event and evrything works as expected. (sorry, for not documenting this)\n\nAbout 2. the webshims implementation of maxlenth:\n\nwebshims only trys to implement this in IE9 (and of course any older browser) and leaves the standard implementation to the browser vendor. In fact, this part of the spec changed last year. Safari, Opera's and webshims lib implementation do not match the current state of the spec. -> FF9 and Chrome are right. This part of the spec can be only tested manually. There is no way to write a unit test.\n\nSo issues:\n1. better documentation\n2. align maxlength to the spec and normalize Safari and Opera\n\ncheers\nalex\n"

Things worked fine with these browsers.\n\nUnfortunately, I am running into a problem testing on my iPhone 3gs running IOS 4. The problem is different than before. No errors are reported in the Safari Mobile console. Form validation works fine in terms of reporting errors for required fields and email fields. However, once I complete the form and all inputs appear valid, the form does not submit. No validation error messages are displayed, which is expected - what is not expected is the form simply does not submit and no request is sent to the server. If I navigate away from the page via another link and go back to the page where the form fields are still filled out, I can then submit the form with no problem.\n\nIt's puzzling and I'm not sure how to debug this further. I'm not seeing any JavaScript errors in the console so my assumption is document ready is firing and my submit event handler is attached as it should be. My best guess is that in this environment even after entering valid inputs Webshims still thinks the form is invalid and is suppressing the submit event. Whatever flag is used to denote an invalid form state seems to be cleared when going back to the page with all the input filled out.\n\nI tried setting customMessages=true again and it didn't make a difference. I tried loading all polyfills and it didn't make a difference. This seems to be a new issue and the only environment I've reproduced it in so far is IOS 4.\n\nSo close, but unfortunately I'm unable upgrade to 1.8.8 in production until I'm able to resolve this problem.\n"

But it is true, that Safaris error messages are really bad, compared to Opera, Chrome and Firefox. If you want to use customized errormessages in Safari. There are multiple possibilities:\n\n## Markup\n\n```\n<input data-errormessage=\"Please fill out this form\" required />\n```\n\n## Config (enable custom messages and replace validation UI)\n\n```\n$.webshims.setOptions('forms', { \n    customMessages: true, \n    replaceValidationUI: true\n});\n```\n\n## Config (replace native validation message, but native validation bubble stays)\n\n```\n$.webshims.setOptions('forms', { \n    overrideMessages: true\n});\n```\n\nThere are a lot more ways to achieve this, but those are the simplest one.\n\nYou can find more informations about custom error messages [here](http://afarkas.github.com/webshim/demos/demos/webforms.html#custom-error) and [here](http://afarkas.github.com/webshim/demos/demos/webforms/1-webforms-lang-custom-bubble.html).

This is specified by the HTML5 spec and webshims doesn't do anything here in case of Chrome/FF.\n\nFrom spec there is no direct way to bring up native validation bubble. The only workaround is to trigger a click event on the submit button. In case of custom messages (config: replaceValidationUI: true), you can trigger the validation constraint by using the checkValidity method, which fires invalid events on invlaid fields and invokes the customized bubbles:\n\n```\n    if($('#myform').checkValidity()){\n        $('#myform').trigger('submit');\n    }\n```\n\nThere are also other ways to do something like this. If you need another way just let me know.\n\n@thomasmaas \n\nThere is no need to fix this, to implement the form attribute. I'm currently working on this, but it's quite complicated to fully support the attribute (including dynamic changes to dom) without having a big performance penalty.\n"

        "body": "1. The shadow DOM is only for UI. If you want to use the API (i.e.: setCustomValidity), you don't have to touch the shadow element. The shadow element is only for CSS. About your general approach: If you want to set a value, again you don't need to touch the shadowElement. You still should access the element you have added to the DOM. To get this reflected to the shadow element, you have to use the general jQuery methods $.val or $.prop. The reason for this is, that it is technically nearly impossible to create getters and setters. The power of webshims is, that while it is not a real polyfill to the DOM, it is a real polyfill to jQuery. jQuery is always used for abstraction and browser normalization. Webshims only adds some small abstraction parts and uses the same jQuery API for normalization. If you want to use native DOM, you have to do the normalization your own.\n2. Like I said, browsers don't really support this. For example Safari has partial support for type=\"date\" and gives you a bad UI. The only way to remove bad UI x-browser is to either remove/change the type attribute or to create a new DOM element. So you need it. You are already using quite a lot classes (more than you need)\n3. Yes, I see a small bug, here. I will fix it. But your type=\"date\" has no border-box, so it's currently calculated right.\n4. http://dev.w3.org/html5/spec/Overview.html#input-type-attr-summary\n"

So you can write your CSS. The CSS with important can be removed with:\n\n```\n$('html').removeClass('polyfill-important');\n```\n1.

        "body": "@jhartikainen \n\nThx, for your bugreport. This is by design. Webshims trys to polyfill and normalize features through the jQuery API. While this isn't 100% native, it is a better solution, then most other scriptable shims provide, because we do not implement a new abstraction API, but use an already existing abstraction layer (jQuery). This is explained in the [docs](http://afarkas.github.com/webshim/demos/index.html#polyfill-abstractions).\n\nThis means everything should work as expected, if you are using $.attr/$.prop or $.val.\n\n```\n//set empty string (shows placeholder)\n$('input').prop('value', '');\n\n//set value (hides plyaceholder)\n$('input').prop('value', 'some value');\n\n//get value (does not return placeholder text)\n$('input').prop('value');\n```\n\nSorry, that this answer might not satisfy you.\n"

But I'm not really happy with this.\n\nIf you write code like the following:\n\n```\n$('input').bind('input', function(){\n    //you should throttle this function for performance\n    if( $(this).is(':invalid') ){\n        //do something\n    }\n});\n```\n\nThe custom validation isn't taken into account. You have to write something like this:\n\n```\n$('input').bind('input', function(){\n    //you should throttle this function for performance\n    if( $(this).trigger('refreshCustomValidityRules').is(':invalid') ){\n        //do something\n    }\n});\n```\n\nI'm currently not sure, wether I want to only recalculate on change event and leave the rest to the developer. Or to do some extra magic.\n\nSome additional information about the current version (1.8.11beta3). There is a known issue in iOS5 for all forms-ext validity features. rangeOverlflow, rangeUnderflow and stepMismatch is always false. This version isn't also heavily cross-browser tested. I'm doing all my tests only right before releasing a new final.\n"

        "body": "Okay, I basically did a binary search on the commits between 1.8.1 and 1.8.2, and I think I've narrowed the problem down to the commit that introduced the performance issues (on 2011-10-08):\n- SHA: 5055db014db70e60c72e988bdeb351b994e40179 was smooth, then\n- SHA: ae049ba7e2cb99e237f8f2355f92b7d546e0b87f was jerky\n\nFor completeness, I did some webshim package comparisons with SHA: 3a956277f52362a24c57c5b946761b70c51acc35, to see how \"forms\" versus \"forms-ext\" performed once data-list support had been completely moved into \"forms-ext\".\nIt's weird, but using \"forms\" doesn't seem to fix the problem, even though data-list should only be included with \"forms-ext\".\n\nI also tried that with \"es5\", and the problem went away.\n\nTo sum up, I believe the following statements are true:\n- `$.webshims.polyfill('es5');` never caused any jerkiness\n- `$.webshims.polyfill('forms');` and `$.webshims.polyfill('forms-ext');` introduced jerkiness with SHA: ae049ba7e2cb99e237f8f2355f92b7d546e0b87f\n- problem is demonstrable with complex forms in a native iOS app with embedded WebKit\n- performance in pure Mobile Safari is too good to properly demonstrate issue\n\nI don't know what conclusions we can draw from this at this stage. Given the actual cost in trying to figure this out (must own an OS X device, an iOS device and have a free Apple developer account) I would forgive you if you said you couldn't help me further.\n\nIf you have more tests you can think of to narrow this down, I'd be delighted to help. At this stage, we will be rolling back to 1.8.1 until this situation is resolved, however we may end up dropping webshims in the longterm (which means I'll have to manage all of these poly-fills myself, yuck).\n"

Both do not fully support input[type=\"date\"], therefore webshims will implement the jQuery UI datepicker, including some localizations. (What browser-based date selector is used there???)\n\n If you are using a german browser and do not override the locale using $.webshims.activeLang, you have to enter dd.mm.yyyy (or d.m.yy), for example.\n\nIf I set the locale to 'en', the default date format is yyyy-mm-dd. But you can still enter yyyy-m-d. You find here a simple gist to try it yourself: http://jsfiddle.net/trixta/vZuLv/\n\nIf you enter 2012-1-1 and wait for the change event, you will get the normalized value '2012-01-01' for the input. Can you help me to reproduce the bug?\n"

If anyone needs either, you can write some code similar to this.  It does not account for cropping:\n\n``` javascript\nvar canvas = $('whatever selector gets your canvas element');\nvar context = canvas.getContext();\n$('body').css('position','relative');\ncontext.drawImage =\n   function( img, x, y, w, h )\n   {\n      $('<img src=\"'+img.src+'\"/>').appendTo('body').css( {\n          height: h+'px',\n          left: (x+canvas.offset().left)+'px',\n          position: 'absolute',\n          top: (y+canvas.offset().top)+'px',\n          width: w+'px',\n          zIndex: 1+canvas.css('zIndex') } )\n   }\n\n```\n\nBasically, the code places an HTML <img> element on top of the canvas whenever drawImage is called.  Note that because the image appears over the canvas, it will hide any subsequent changes to the canvas at the image location.\n"

The reason for this spec violation is... \n1. input[type=\"date\"] should behave more like a select element, but jQuery UI is more an free input element and a dateformat hint is very important\n2. placeholder has better support and it is a good fallback for JS off sites, to let the user know the dateformat.\n\nUsage:\n\n```\n<input type=\"date\" placeholder=\"year-month-day\" />\n```\n\nIf the placeholder can split into 3 parts using \"-\", this is transfered to the localized format i.e. day.month.year\n"

Please note, that the dateformat you see is still different from 1.8.10 and is dependent from the locale of your browser. (It's a feature not a bug). The default for 'en' is mm/dd/yy (https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/blob/master/ui/jquery.ui.datepicker.js#L56). If you want to change this, you have two possibilities.\n\nSimply change the locale manually. It'is recommended to do this before calling the polyfill method:\n\n```\n$.webshims.activeLang('ja'); //change to japanese\n```\n\nOr by using the datepicker option:\n\n```\n$.webshims.setOptions('forms-ext', {\n    datepicker: { \n        dateFormat: 'yy-mm-dd'\n    } \n});\n```\n\nYou can find more informations here:\nhttp://afarkas.github.com/webshim/demos/demos/webforms/3-webforms-widgets.html\n"

This fix has to be bound before replaceValidationUI handlers are bound, but after detecting Modernizr.bugfreeformvalidation && !webshims.bugs.bustedValidity features/bugs. (Because of e.stopImmediatePropagation();). Both things are happening in the same file, so it's quite difficult to achieve.\n\nTry to change the following line:\n\nform:\n     $(document).bind('invalid', function(e){\n\nto:\n     $(window).bind('invalid', function(e){\n\nI haven't tested this, but hope this works for you. Due to the fact that replaceValidationUI binds to the document, but the false invalid should start to be propagated at the window object, you can stop it there a little bit earlier.\n"

I plan to release a cross browser tested release in about two weeks, until then the dev version can be a little bit rough, so don't use in production. But developing/testing with this version really helps me to find bugs :-) so thanks\n"

        "body": "This would be easy, please read how to [implement a new feature](http://afarkas.github.com/webshim/demos/index.html#implement-polyfill). But I won't do this my own.\n\nmediaelementjs doesn't really follow the principles of a polyfill, because it mixes polyfilling with extending, without providing some of the base features.\n\nWhat do you think are the problems with webshims medialement implementation? My opinion is that webshims mediaelement implementation is the most accurate implementation, you can currently get.\n\n### accurate DOM API\n\nIf you are testing [following fiddle](http://jsfiddle.net/trixta/VvmmC/), you can see that a mediaelement is connected to some form elements including input[type=\"range\"] and vice versa. If you are using a HTML5 capable browser, which supports both [type=\"range\"] and mediaelements (for example chrome/safari/opera), you can simply remove modernizr and polyfiller from the resource panel and the hole code still works as expected. Currently webshims lib is the only \"shim/polyfill\", which gives you this experience. All other polyfills are using an abstraction layer, so you can't use the HTML5 DOM API. (Wesbhims is also using an abstraction, but we do not introduce a new abstraction layer, we are simply using an existing one -> jQuery and this makes webshims so powerfull). I'm really proud about this.\n\n### still simply styleable\n\nWhile webshims doesn't extend the mediaelement feature with styling features, it's quite easy, to build some. And if you don't want to build stylable controls for mediaelement yourself, you can simply use [JME2](https://github.com/aFarkas/jMediaelement). The intersting part here is also, in HTML5 capable browsers JME2 works without webshims. This is just so impressive.\n\n### the only problem: no free and open source flash player\n\nThe only problem I have with my implementation is, that I don't use a free and open source flash player. But I don't know any good one. But JW player is a really good tradeoff between price and stability and features.\n"

To test you can also simply add this file into the minified/shims/i18n folder. In case you have ant you can build webshims yourself. But as soon as your pr is here, I will pull and build myself.\n"

You'd have to modify the webshims source temporarily to do this.\n\nUpdating to the latest jQuery and experimenting with different event handling approaches might also help: e.g. attaching events to `document` or `body` with bubbling versus attaching events directly to each element instance.\n"

        "body": "Thanks for the testcase. Somehow my normal account eats your mails as spam. the other address (@aperto) worked.\n\nI could track down the bug. You are adding the form dynamically and webshims doesn't track dynamic changes to the DOM automatically. To inform webshims about changes to the DOM, you should use special methods instead of the normal jQuery manipulation methods.:\n\n```\n//append -> appendPolyfill; html -> htmlPolyfill; appendTo -> appendPolyfillTo;\n$('div.main').htmlPolyfill('<div>my new content</div>');\n```\n\nIf the code of your manipulation script can't or shouldn't be changed to one of those methods (for example it is a third party script), you can also hook into a callback/event of this script and call updatePolyfill on the ancestor of the new content.\n\n```\n$('#my-dynamic-container').load('ajax/test.html', function(){ \n    $(this).updatePolyfill(); \n});\n```\n\nYou can find more information about this [here](http://afarkas.github.com/webshim/demos/index.html#polyfill-abstractions) and [here](http://afarkas.github.com/webshim/demos/demos/shiv.html#dynamic).\n\nalthough, I didn't find the code, where I should hook into, calling the following line from the script console in IE8/IE9, after loading the form into the dialog did the trick:\n\n```\n$('.wa-modal-body').updatePolyfill();\n```\n\nCould you please close the bug, if this answer resolves your problem?\n"

We use Backbone js and are considering wrapping the render method to always call updatePolyfill after rendering.  The problem is that will cause updatePolyfill to be call multiple times for the same elements because we sometimes render subviews in the render method.  As a result, that subview will have updatePolyfill called twice.\n2.  Is there a way to tell if an element has webshim's active?  We would like to log a warning if we dynamically render an item but don't updatePolyfill or use htmlPolyfill?\n"

However it is possible, that some styles of your site are applied to the step-control. There are some points about the step-controls, which make them a little bit errorprone, but also flexible to add custom styles. Therefore, there might be cases, where I wouldn't fix a misplacement and would suggest, that the developer is using CSS to correct the misplacement. Here is an [example](http://jsfiddle.net/trixta/WJxFe/).\n\nTherefore, I need a testcase to decide, wether this is a fixable bug.\n"

        "body": "I know this is odd, but I have multiple reasons for doing this. The problem is, that we would need shadow dom features to get this right. First webshims [type=\"date\"] polyfill is seperated into UI and API. \n- detection can go wrong (in case of a false negative,the user gets a busted input)\n- datepicker should always show localized formats (i.e. MM/DD/YYYY), while the value should be always in specified format (YYYY-MM-DD)\n- replace the UI even in good browsers, but still use the API of the native implementation \n\nYour example with required isn't right. Actually webshims leverages the native implementation of required in supporting browsers. The only thing, is that webshims detects the error on the native element and shows the polyfill UI on the replaced element. Something to know, while we have this separation on the UI-side. Scripting should be fine to use, means: To get/set properties like value/valueAsNumber/valueAsDate etc. always use $('#date-input').prop('valueAsnumber'/'value'). Even most events like change/input are transferred.\n"

        "body": "Indeed this is intersting for both things:\n- using it as a base for DOM polyfills\n- implementing a polyfill\n\nWebshims already has some very similiar helper methods, to implement elements and thier attributes/properties. You can find [some information here](http://afarkas.github.com/webshim/demos/index.html#implement-polyfill).\n\nThe problem with x-tag is, that it doesn't work in IE8- and you can't really polyfill this feature. (Just think of shadowdom and so on)\n\nBUT: I honestly think, webdevelopers should start to use such techniques to write re-usable HTML-components. You won't always need to use \"x-elements\". You can also use markup like this:\n\n```\n<div class=\"accordion\" data-config='{\"toggle\": true, \"multiple\": true}'>\n```\n\nWhich would create an accordion, where the elements can be opened and closed on click (normally only opened) and there are multiple open elements allowed.\n\nI'm trying to use this technique in a project called jme. In this project the following markup creates a time display associated to a audio/video element:\n\n```\n<div class=\"mediaplayer\">\n    <video src=\"...\"></video>\n    <span class=\"currenttime-display\"></span>\n</div>\n```\n\nIf you want to change the time format (default mm:ss), you can write something like this:\n\n```\n<div class=\"mediaplayer\">\n    <video src=\"...\"></video>\n    <span class=\"currenttime-display\"  data-jme='{\"format\": \"hh:mm:ss\"}'></span>\n</div>\n```\n\nAll data-jme attributes can be changed also by calling, jmeProp:\n\n```\n$('.currenttime-display').jmeProp({\n    format: \"hh:mm:ss\",\n    countdown: true\n});\n```\n"

        "body": "You can not detect the dependencies from the ant file. This file is just for making the combos. It's quite complicated. To get an idea:\n1. Go to the http://afarkas.github.com/webshim/demos/index.html\n2. enter $.webshims.modules into your console\n\nNow you see all modules. Normally each module is represented by one file. Now you can look into a module. There are 3 different interesting properties:\n1. c: represents the combos\n2. d: represensts the dependencies\n3. f: represents the feature (if there is no f. the file itself is the only needed feature file).\n\nBut I don't think, that the build script has to exclude unsued files/combos, because we only have to make sure, that this combo isn't loaded. This is where feature-dummy comes into play. This \"feature\" is a \"non-feature\", which is always supported and get's all combos, which shouldn't be loaded, if we remove a feature from the polyfiller.js\n\nI would try to write a simple version of a new webshims builder next week. Also look into the [builder](https://github.com/aFarkas/webshim/blob/master/demos/demo-js/demo.js#L66) + the polyfiller.js script\n"

There are some examples demonstrating the API:\n-   example using only CSShttp://jsfiddle.net/trixta/NnNKv/\n-   example using the JS-APIhttp://jsfiddle.net/trixta/tLXXN/\n\nTo give you full control, you always need to use the JS-API to get the Job down. Here is a good article explaining the APIhttp://www.html5rocks.com/en/tutorials/forms/constraintvalidation/. If you still have problems, let me know your full requirements, I can try to build a simple example on that.\n\n\u2014\nReply to this email directly or view it on GitHubhttps://github.com/aFarkas/webshim/issues/181#issuecomment-10192366.\n"

This is described [here](http://afarkas.github.com/webshim/demos/demos/shiv.html#dynamic) and here(https://github.com/aFarkas/webshim/issues/166#issuecomment-9207336) you find a similiar issue with a short explanation\n2. In case you have included jQuery UI, webshims doesn't load the jQuery UI dependency. To implement datepicker, webshims needs jQuery UI widget, core and datepicker and for slider, webshims needs widget, core, mouse and slider.\n\nSo if you have for example included widget and core, but not datepicker, mouse and slider. Get those files, merge them into one file. And configure $.webshims.modules[\"input-widgets\"].src to point to this file (you have to use a relative path from the shims directory or an absolute path). You can find some information about this [here](afarkas.github.com/webshim/demos/demos/webforms/3-webforms-widgets.html#partial-ui-loading)\n\n```\n$.webshims.modules[\"input-widgets\"].src = \"../jquery-ui.slider-datepicker.min.js\";\n```\n"

I haven't included any jquery ui code myself. the only change was setting waitReady to false and calling polyfill() from within angular....\n\noh well, it works :) thanks for the whole webshim-lib, it's very usefull when supporting non-compliant browsers.\n"

So they are pretty fast even in IE7. However, webshims currently does not always properly detect, wether an element already was \"shim-med\". So if you  call updatePolyfill multiple times on an element, which hasn't changed, it might lead to some other problems (events are bound twice and so on). I will open a ticket for this.\n\nAbout the other problem, it might be possible, that partial jQuery UI is loaded after webshims and if you delay the polyfill call, it is there, if not, webshims will load the full jQuery UI. However for performance it is always best to configure the jQuery UI module and only include the files you need.\n"

And sorry for the delay, I was very sick, jQuery UI is overloading outerWidth for a while and jQuery 1.8 has implemented the feature to use outerWidth also as a setter. \n\nNeither jQuery UI nor jQuery want to change the signature of outerWidth. I think you are either using an incompatible combination of jQuery and jQuery UI (You are using jQuery edge with jQuery UI 1.8.x in your fiddle. But you have to use jQuery UI 1.9.2+ inconjunction with jQuery 1.8.2+) or it is a bug in jQuery edge. But I'm pretty sure the code changes aren't needed.\n"

        "body": "@czachor \n\nThanks for the testcase. This is a more complex problem (for me). But I need to improve this behavior in the future. Currently you can fix your issue by changing your div#add-sample-helper to a script element with a special type attribute:\n\n```\n<script type=\"template/html\" id=\"add-sample-helper\">\n    //your form html\n</script>\n```\n\nNote: You need to set the type attribute to something like \"template/...\"\n\nAnother thing about your placeholder. The normal format of date is yyyy-mm-dd and a placeholder is not allowed on type=\"date\". However webshims will read the data-placeholder attribute and sets it on the shimed element.\n\nTry the following:\n\n```\n<input type=\"date\" data-placeholder=\"RRRR-MM-DD\" />\n```\n\nNote that, I'm using the normal W3C format and webshims automatically converts it to your locale.\n"

Here is a simplified testcase:\n\n```\n<!DOCTYPE html>\n<html>\n<head>\n    <title>Test</title>\n    <script src=\"http://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.9.1/jquery.js\"></script>\n    <script>\n        $(document).on('.dropdown-menu', function (e) { e.stopPropagation() }); // $(document).on('', $.noop);\n        $(document).off('.bar'); //$(document).off('.dropdown-menu');\n        console.log($._data(document, 'events'))\n    </script>\n</head>\n<body>\n</body>\n</html>\n```\n\nThe following code: `$(document).on('.dropdown-menu', function (e) { e.stopPropagation() });` does not mean bind a handler and execute it, whenever an event with the namespace `'.dropdown-menu'` is triggered. It simply means bind to an event with name `\"\"` (empty string). Using an empty string as an event name is neither supported nor a good idea.\n\nSo bootstrap has to change thier code.\n"

They come from the browser.\n\nIf you want to control those messages, you can use either the following config:\n\n```\n$.webshims.setOptions({\n    forms: {\n        customMessages: true,\n        replaceValidationUI: true\n    }\n});\n```\n\nor the more obtrusive way (not recommended):\n\n```\n$.webshims.setOptions({\n    forms: {\n        overrideMessages: true\n    }\n});\n```\n\nDoes this help?\n"

(DOM-APIs are all $.prop methods or special methods like play/checkValidity).\n\nIn case you only want to use Markup-API (i.e. simple HTML or $.attr), you won't need to delay the ready event.\n\nFrom your code I assume, you are only using Markup-APIs and your problem is, that the new dynamic content isn't \"polyfilled\". To get this done, simply call updatePolyfill on the container of the new content. A short description is documented [here](http://afarkas.github.com/webshim/demos/demos/shiv.html#dynamic) and [here](http://afarkas.github.com/webshim/demos/index.html#polyfill-abstractions):\n\n```\n$.webshims.polyfill('forms forms-ext');\n$(function() {\n    $(\"#load-div\").load('myfile.html', function() { // callback for after load is done\n        $(this).updatePolyfill();\n    });\n});\n```\n\nIn case you don't want the ready event delayed, you can use the following options (This means, that DOM might be faster ready, but it's not safe to use HTML5 DOM-APIs), which is documented [here](http://afarkas.github.com/webshim/demos/index.html#polyfill-options):\n\n```\n$.webshims.setOptions({ \n    waitReady: false\n});\n$.webshims.polyfill('forms forms-ext');\n$(function() {\n    //load after DOM-READY but before new content is arrived (better against FOUC)\n    $(\"#load-div\").load('myfile.html', function() { // callback for after load is done\n        $(this).updatePolyfill();\n    });\n});\n```\n\nCould you please close this issue, if this answers your question(s).\n"

Actually the IE modes in IE10 are totally busted and it's not a webshims bug, it's a general MSIE/jQuery issue.\n\nThe following code returns an empty string (\"\") in IE10 in IE8mode\n\n```\n$('<form />').attr('novalidate'); //should return undefined, but returns \"\" in IE8mode of IE10, but not in real IE8 or IE8mode of IE9\n```\n\nThis is the reason, why the script fails. It might be possible, that I can fix this with webshims, but...\n- it's a jQuery bug and should be fixed there\n- it's a IE10 mode bug and you shouldn't test your app/site using IE10 browser modes, anymore. \n\nCould you fill a bug in jQuery's bugtracker for me? As said the code above should return undefined. There might be other busted attributes as well. In most cases jQuery has to use getAttributeNode or attributes[name].specified to fix this issue.\n\nAgain this isn't happening in real IE8 or IE8mode of IE9!\n"

Bower and component.io have very different goals. \n\nBower is meant to provide a repository to full libraries, so things like jquery, it's plugins, modernizr, etc would go into bower as-is. \n\ncomponent.io has much more ambitious goals; to break up large monolithic libraries into their subcomponents. So the idea is that front end libraries could be structured more like node modules; small pieces with clear dependencies. If your code only uses 6 functions from jquery, you'd only pull in those 6 relevant modules by declaring them as dependencies the way npm's package.json file does.\n\n> Can it handle Modernizr tests?\n\nI think the biggest weakness of component.io in it's current form is that it depends on large projects being broken up into pieces and that hasn't happened. yet.\n"

I was just able to download and test webshims-master.zip and encountered the following problems:\n\n(1)  in IE7 mode, clicking the calendar budget does not display the popup.  It works fine in IE8, IE9 and IE10 mode.  I am using a custom Modernizr 2.6.2 which includes all of the feature tests from the link on your home page, and jQuery 1.9.1.\n\n(2)  in IE10 and Firefox 20.0.1 (which both use date and month shims), the CSS for the :invalid pseudoclass is not applied to the field when it is empty and the required attribute is set.\n\nYou can see this behavior at http://beta.dealingtree.com/join/\n\nI've found a couple of other unrelated problems, but I will report those using the issue tracker.  Let me know if you want me to list these two bugs there, also.\n\nThanks again for your hard work and for sharing Webshims Lib with the community!\n\nAndrew\n\n----- Original Message ----- \nFrom: Alexander Farkas \nTo: aFarkas/webshim \nCc: Andrew M.

        "body": "@AMA3 \n\nThanks, yes I would like to know all issues/problems. \n1. IE7 mode: While the css on the demo page is busted for IE7. The calendar widget works just fine for me in real IE7. Are you testing with IE10 in his browser modes? If yes: I can't support IE10' browser modes with webshims, because those are totally busted and different from the original IE7/IE8/IE9. You can use IETester or a real IE7/8/9 instead\n2. This was never supported. Webshims hides the original element and shows a custom UI. I can add a configuration option, that adds support for this, but this also means, that the number of invalid elements will be higher if you polyfill (original + the UI inputs). Additionally, this will never work in IE9/8. \n\nWebshims instead implements/shims the much better CSS4 selector :user-error (shim is .user-error). An easy workaround for you would be the following selector:\n\n```\n:invalid + .ws-month,\n:invalid + .ws-date {\n\n}\n```\n"

That said, I believe that Webshims Lib would be even better if it supported :invalid directly without requiring the adjacent sibling selectors.  One of the reasons I love Webshims Lib so much is that it makes everything seem so \"automatic\"--just include the scripts and write one line of JS code, and no other special handling is usually required.  The lack of direct support for :invalid contradicts this.\n\nI do notice that the replacement date widget is a bit too narrow in FF20; I can't see the entire date string.  It looks fine in IE7 and IE10.\n\nThanks again for everything, Webshims Lib is a much-appreciated contribution to the web community.\n"

Webshims' datepicker for example is implemented according to the [WAI-ARIA 1.0 Authoring Practices](http://www.w3.org/WAI/PF/aria-practices/#datepicker). An [input[type=\"range\"] with labeled datalist options](http://jsfiddle.net/trixta/qxCcz/) does not only render range ticks, but also enhances the spoken value in screenreaders using aria-valuetext.\n"

The interesting part of webshims is indeed, that I do not try to invent a new abstraction layer. I simply use jQuery  build in methods and extend those. Especially this makes webshims so special over all shims, which implement new abstractions and therefore have to be loaded in all browsers.\n"

I would expect the shim to behave like the real thing by default.  As I've said before, what makes Webshims Lib so awesome is that you write one like of JS code ($.webshims.polyfill(\"...\")) and everything works as expected in deficient browsers... so requiring the extra step of calling setOptions to make the form work as expected isn't really any better (and might actually be more work) than adding .ws-date, etc to the CSS.  Would you please turn on mirrorValidity by default?\n"

        "body": "@AMA3 \n\nUnfortunatley the problem is quite more complex and it is impossible for me to do the right thing. You want to make it feel as native as possible, so do I. If you run the following code `alert($(':invalid').length)` inside the jsfiddle above you will see, that the length of invalid elements is higher than in the same jsfiddle with mirrorValidity turned off. The key problem is, we don't have shadow dom in all browsers yet and therefore webshims' UI components can be reached with JS/CSS. With other words `mirrorValidity = true` makes CSS feel more native and `mirrorValidity = false` makes JS feel more native.\n\nSo I have to decide, which is more important. And these are some of the points:\n- :invalid selector is considered bad for CSS usage (more important here: :user-error),  but quite good for JS, i.e.: QSA and matchesSelector\n- :invalid selector can never ever work in IE-7-9 or FF 3.6, which are also supported by webshims. Why should I make an option on by default, which can't work in 50% of supported browsers?\n- mirrorValidity is using setCustomValdity behind the scenes. setCustomValidity is a quite obtrusive method and can result in some unexpected problems/errors. For me I would appreciate it, if the WhatWG/W3C would add a addCustomValidationRule/RemoveCustomValidationRule API instead.\n"

        "body": "Hi Alex, I can appreciate the need to decide which features take priority.  I don't think that you can say that :invalid is always bad for CSS and that :user-error is always good; rather, that there are situations when one is preferable over the other.  :invalid is useful for when a form is initially displayed, to help the user know which fields require their attention.  And although legacy browser support is certainly important, I think that modern-yet-incomplete browser support is equally important.  In the case of FF, is a site more likely to have users coming in with FF3.6 or with FF21?  FF users tend to update their browsers more frequently than IE users.  But even IE10 users deserve the best experience that we can give them.\n\nMaybe the optimal solution is for Webshims Lib to test whether the browser will support mirrorValidity and turn it on for those that do.  In answering the question, is it more important for CSS to feel more native or JS, I think that more sites will need the CSS to feel native than the JS, and again, detecting browser support can help in both regards.\n\nUltimately, though, I think this introduces a bigger concern:  the reason that I use Webshims Lib and teach it as the best solution in all of my HTML5 classes is that it's very much a drop-in solution with virtually no customization required.  Other polyfills I've seen require too much setup/customization just to get them to work.  Right now we're only discussing one issue, but I'm afraid that if we make exceptions for the :invalid selector, then it's a slippery slope to make other exceptions as well.\n\nAlex, you do such a wonderful job making Webshims Lib the easiest, most encompassing polyfill I've ever seen, and I feel very confident teaching it to the hundreds of students who attend my HTML5 course every year.  Please keep up the good work, and be careful to maintain its ease-of-use as you continue to improve it.\n"

        "body": "I have a very strong opinion on this and you couldn't convice me. \n\n### 1. CSS more important than JS\n\nMaybe, but not in case of :invalid. See here:\n\n> Tantek: More background here: one of the reasons for :-moz-ui-invalid was a short-term fix to be able to build UI because :invalid wasn't reasonable for UI.\n> http://logs.csswg.org/irc.w3.org/css/?date=2012-08-13\n\nor\n\n> UX concerns with the current approach...\n> http://alistapart.com/article/forward-thinking-form-validation#section5\n\nThere are more, believe me.\n\n### 2. :invalid has to be right in JS in the first place\n\na) It's important for JS\nHere is a small demo, which breaks with mirrorValidity: http://jsfiddle.net/trixta/B8pBA/\nAs you can see, the small script can really add much more meaning to the invalid form. And this is a key point about HTML5 form validation. The validation UI of HTML5 was designed to be compatible with all forms, which is good, but it wasn't designed with good UX. If you want to achieve this, you have to learn the DOM-API to improve it. Please teach this your students (see also http://www.html5rocks.com/en/tutorials/forms/constraintvalidation).\n\nI have added a simple but powerfull instant/real-time validation into webshims (see http://jsfiddle.net/trixta/XqPhQ/), but I think people should learn how to this themself.\n\nb) Webshims always behaved this way\nYou really need to have extrem strong arguments to change a behavior, which will break existing scripts\n\n### 3. setCustomValidity is in use\n\nsetCustomValidity is used, which means you have to keep track all kind of possible changes. This is quite unrealistic. Just think of a form autocomplete plugin (or next generation autocomplete attribute feature, soon in chrome).\n\nIn general: I'm always open to all kind of feature requests and options, but if I can't do it right, I simply can't do it right. You wanted this feature, here it is. But especially because of 2 and 3 I have decided to make it an opt-in. And myself will never ever opt-in.\n"

The best thing you can do: \"Disable it.\" The main feature of the textinput widget is to wrap all input elements in a container. To be honest, I don't understand, that a libary for mobile devices is heavily altering the DOM only for layout issues. \n\nHere is a quick workaround, which has to run before domready/pagecreate whatever:\n\n```\n$.mobile.textinput.prototype.options.initSelector = $.map($.mobile.textinput.prototype.options.initSelector.split(', '), function(sel){\n    return sel+':not(.ws-important-hide)';\n}).join(', ');\n\n$(document).on('textinputinit', function(e){\n    var parent = $(e.target).parent()\n    parent.next('.input-buttons').appendTo(parent);\n    parent.prev('.ws-important-hide').addClass('ui-input-text').prependTo(parent);\n});\n```\n\nOf course you need to attach right styles to the input button element itself.\n\nI couldn't reproduce the IE10 bug, so I really need a testcase for that.\n"

If you want to see custom messages in all browsers you have to do two things (see also: http://afarkas.github.io/webshim/demos/demos/webforms.html#custom-error):\n1. add customMessages to true:\n   $.webshims.setOptions('forms', { customMessages: true });\n\nor (better for performance but messages are not ready on DOM-ready):\n\n```\n$.webshims.setOptions('forms', { lazyCustomMessages: true });\n```\n1. replace native UI with custom UI\n\nThere are a lot of ways to do this. The most easiest way is by config:\n\n```\n$.webshims.setOptions('forms', { replaceValidationUI: true });\n```\n\nIf you want to see a specific language you should set activeLang:\n\n```\nwebshims.activeLang('ja');\n```\n\nAll config should be called before you invoke the webshims.polyfill method.\n\nHope this helps.\n"

Something about installing CSS via npm just doesn't sit right with me. \u2026plus, I like that bower takes care of version conflicts by forcing you to choose one, instead of just including both.\n\nIt's not super ideal, but the rule is simple: client side code gets installed via bower, server-side via NPM. If it's being used in both places, use judgement, but NPM should probably win.\n\nI took a look at browsernizr, but it looked like a lot of complexity for something that is both a) going through a [major rewrite](http://modernizr.com/news/modernizr-v3-stickers-diversity/) and b) the online build tool is so easy to use. Basically, I'm willing to put up with \"the wrong\" way of doing things for a while :)\n\nUsually, I just use the build of modernizr included with webshims. If I need something more custom, I'll use webshims [build as a base, and then use modernizr's build tool on top of that](http://modernizr.com/download/#-canvas-audio-video-input-inputtypes-localstorage-sessionstorage-geolocation-shiv-cssclasses-addtest-prefixed-testprop-testallprops-prefixes-domprefixes-elem_track-load).\n"

It is, however, not production ready yet and upgrading within the next year (completely different UI, all custom models need to be upgraded, etc. ) is not an option.\n\nFurthermore i don't like the approach of putting css, js and imgs together. This structure feels so \"messy\" :)\n\nPS: Great work though - after comparing several solutions, I've come to the conclusion that webshims lib is by far the best / most stable.\n"

It's really a pain in the ass, that Chrome/Safari have a wrong implementation for the change event. This is not only true for input[type=\"range\"]. The implementation is wrong in case of all new HTML5 input types (date, number, month etc.).\n"

I think you want to configure the placing of the datepicker dialog. This can be achieved with the popover configuration.\n\nHere is an example:\n\n```\n<input type=\"date\" data-wspopover='{\"appendTo\": \"body\"}' />\n```\n\nThis will place the modal to the body element. You can add any selector or the keywords 'auto' or 'element'. Can you give me an example. I would try to improve the 'auto' algorythm then.\n"

        "body": "Haha, this bug is a bit crazy. I've now isolated it (but it took a little while):\n\nIf the password field has a procentual width (like width: 100%) AND its wrapper has \"display: none;\" set, it triggers the bug in IE8.\n\nHere's some code to replicate it:\n\n```\n<!doctype html>\n<html>\n<head>\n    <title>Oh you little...</title>\n    <meta charset=\"utf-8\">\n    <meta http-equiv=\"X-UA-Compatible\" content=\"IE=edge,chrome=1\">\n    <meta name=\"description\" content=\"Whatevs\">\n    <meta name=\"viewport\" content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0\"/>  \n    <script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"js/modernizr.js\"></script>\n    <style type=\"text/css\">\n        .hiddenform-wrapper {\n            display: none;\n        }\n        .hiddenform-wrapper.active {\n            display: block;\n        }\n        input {\n            width: 50%;\n        }\n    </style>\n</head>\n\n<body class=\"\">\n    <div class=\"hiddenform-wrapper\">\n        <form>\n            <input type=\"email\" placeholder=\"e-mail\">\n            <input type=\"password\" placeholder=\"password\">\n            <input type=\"submit\" value=\"Test\">\n        </form>\n    </div>\n    <button type=\"button\" id=\"showform\">Show form</button>\n\n<script type=\"text/javascript\">\n    Modernizr.load([\n            { load: 'js/jquery-1.10.2.min.js'},\n            { \n                load: 'js/polyfiller.js',\n                complete: function() {\n                    //change webshims options\n                    $.webshims.setOptions({\n                        waitReady: false,\n                        basePath: \"js/shims/\",\n                        activeLang: 'sv'\n                    });\n\n                    //start polyfilling\n                    $.webshims.polyfill('forms');\n\n                    $('#showform').click(function() {\n                        $('.hiddenform-wrapper').toggleClass('active');\n                    });\n                }\n            }\n        ]);\n</script>\n\n</body>\n</html>\n```\n\nSo I can avoid the bug by either removing display: none; while the shim is initializing (and put it back later), or if I don't set a procentual width to the input field. It's kind of annoying having to either though ;p\n"

She exists in a dimension of quirk.  No one else has complained about it, so far, so I'm going to let it be.\n\nHowever, the scroll issue I was having, and that problem happens with every browser I've used: If the time picker is forced to be near the bottom of the page, and the hour popup opens, part of it goes below the fold, there's no way to pull the scrollbar down to see it.  It goes away if you try to use the scrollbar.  The mouse wheel works fine, but some people use their trackpads, and hence, they have to use the scrollbar.\n\nAlso, I'm stylizing all the input widgets so that they are uniform, so I don't need to remove the webshims I've already got, but I will try the jQueryUI modification and see what that does.\n"

Something I want to do is to use only `webshims.polyfill`or `webshim.polyfill` (without $.) in future docs and all examples. (See the doc refactor).\n\nI want to make webhim's polyfiller.js independent from jQuery. So that people can start downloading polyfills from the document's head and embed jQuery at the end of the body, which is not the best option for perfomance, but better than the default setup of most developers. \n\nI think this will add about 3-4kb compressed and will remove support of IE7. I'm not sure wether I should have 2 different polyfiller.js files for this or the filesize/no IE7 support is negligible. Actually it is, but some people might see it different.\n"

So if you want to change the locale you have to use `replaceUI` for Chrome and Safari mobile. Normally, I'm using `replaceUI: true` on Desktop and `replaceUI: false` on mobile browsers. About your validation problem. What do you have to do? Can I help. If it's not a bug just some questions, use http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/webshim\n"

Currently changelog.md is removed from master, but might have a comeback. Some people might load webshims over bower or similiar.\n\nHave you seen some of the changes, I have done? (https://github.com/aFarkas/webshim/blob/master/demos/demos/forms.html and https://github.com/aFarkas/webshim/blob/master/demos/widget-configs.html)\n\nLast one will be removed, if it's documented. I have started to remove all JS config, which should be done with CSS (i. e. [showWeeks](https://github.com/aFarkas/webshim/blob/master/demos/widget-configs.html#L159-162), [navSelect](https://github.com/aFarkas/webshim/blob/master/demos/widget-configs.html#L152-156)) and added some default styling to some [hidden elements](https://github.com/aFarkas/webshim/blob/master/demos/widget-configs.html#L81-83), which can simply turned [on/off](https://github.com/aFarkas/webshim/blob/master/demos/widget-configs.html#L138-140) to configure a widget without any JS.\n"

There are two important points. \n1. dynamically creating dom elements: You have sepcial methods for dynamic adding elements. appendPolyfill/htmlPolyfill/insertPolyfillAfter/updatePolyfill and so on.\n2. no shadowdom. webshims sometimes has to alter the dom, to create the HTML5 UI.\n   Unfortunatley I haven't created a clonePolyfill method, so you clone isn't that simple\n\nhttp://jsfiddle.net/CnnWC/16/\n"

You have to distinguish between Chrome, Firefox and IE < 10. \n\nIn case you load the forms polyfill IE will behave exactly the same like FF without any polyfill. (pattern seems to work).\n\nIn case you load the forms and the forms-ext polyfill IE will work exactly the same like chrome. But FF will behave a little bit different here. The reason is simple: FF does implement pattern, but not type=number. (And I do not check wether pattern attribute is used correctly in FF).\n\nBy definition pattern does **not** apply to type=\"number\", your pattern is a spec violation and isn't taken into account by IE (if fully polyfilled) or in Chrome (fully capable). Additionally you can simply skip $ and ^ those are automatically added.\n\nI think you want to have something like this:\n\n```\n<input type=\"number\" step=\"0.01\" />\n```\n\nor\n\n```\n<input type=\"number\" step=\"0.01\" min=\"0\" />\n```\n\nDoes this help?

You can measure the exact performance with the following code:\n\n``` js\nconsole.time('updateshadowdom');\n$(document).triggerHandler('updateshadowdom');\nconsole.timeEnd('updateshadowdom');\n```\n\nBut you simply should look how responsive your site feels using this. It's not werid at all. JS can not get positions and real dimension on hidden elements (display: none) (see also documentation [re-rendering shadowdom](http://afarkas.github.io/webshim/demos/index.html#polyfill-abstractions). Therefore webshims needs to re-calculate this. I might improve performance here with future releases. If you see that performance is really bad. You can fully disable width calculation:\n\n``` js\nwebshims.setOptions('forms-ext', {\n    widgets: {\n        calculateWidth: false\n    }\n});\n```\n\nIn this case you have to set width/margins for native **and** polyfilled elements your own.\n"

        "body": "Thanks, this isn't that easy, because you have to write action script. I'm currently not sure, wether everything I want is possible.\n\nFirst of all, here is what we have:\nFlash has to fully intercept the input[type=file] user interaction to get the data for the filereader api. Which means the file isn't in your HTML and only in the swf plugin world. \n\nGoing from there, it should be easy to intercept JS calls and delegate those to swf to mimic/shim an AJAX form/AJAX upload.\n\nSomething I don't know about, but what would be great is, wether it is possible that we can transfer the data from flash directly into the markup/dom world, so that a normal unfancy form submit works as expected. (I know that the object element is also a submittable form element, but don't know how this works and if swf is capable of doing this. If not we have to go the way that, we intercept a form submit and let flash submit the hole data using the AJAX shim and then somehow handle the response.\n\nBut yeah, we have to write a lot of action script for this. If you investigate on this a little bit, it would be great.\n"

Try the following:\n\n``` css\n.input-picker {max-width: none;}\n```\n\nIf this doesn't help I really need the CSS which is applyed to .input-picker. Note, if you have very general CSS like: `form div` this can conflict with webshims. If such conflicting CSS is typically used or makes sense, I will fix this, if not you have to fix it inside your CSS your own.\n"

Try the following code:\n\n``` js\nwebshims.setOptions('forms', {\n    //show custom styleable validation bubble\n    replaceValidationUI: true,\n    lazyCustomMessages: true\n});\n\n//override valueMissing defaultMessage\nwebshims.validityMessages.en = {\n    valueMissing: {\n        defaultMessage: 'Please fill out this field. {%title}'\n    }\n};\nwebshims.activeLang('en');\n//start polyfilling\nwebshims.polyfill('forms');\n```\n\nOr a little bit more sophisticated automatically add title placeholder to all errormessages as soon as they load:\n\n``` js\n(function(){\n\n    var titleEnhanced = {};\n    function addTitlePlaceholder(){\n        var addTitleToString, currentObj;\n        if(this.__active && !titleEnhanced[this.__activeName]){\n            addTitleToString = function(prop, value){\n                if(typeof value == 'string'){\n                    if(value.indexOf('{%title}') == -1){\n                        currentObj[prop] += ' <span class=\"title-attr\">{%title}</span>';\n                    }\n                } else if($.isPlainObject(value)){\n                    currentObj = value;\n                    $.each(value, addTitleToString);\n                }\n            };\n            currentObj = this.__active;\n            titleEnhanced[this.__activeName] = true;\n            $.each(currentObj, addTitleToString);\n        }\n    }\n    $(webshims.validityMessages)\n        .on('change', addTitlePlaceholder)\n        .each(addTitlePlaceholder);\n})();\n```\n\nDoes this help?\n"

Due to the nature of webshims and especially the fact, that we can not use real shadowdom to build the widgets it's always possible to break the UI.

In your case you [simply have to write](http://jsfiddle.net/trixta/4cLT2/2/):\n\n``` css\ninput,\ninput + .input-buttons {\n    margin-bottom: 30px;\n}\n```\n\n If I would test for every specific possible conflicting style my JS/CSS would be more and more bloated and page performance would be decreased. In case, I would \"fix\" this, I would more likley write the following CSS than dynamically reading the computed style to adjust the buttons position:\n\n``` css\n.has-input-buttons, html > body input.ws-inputreplace.has-input-buttons, span.has-input-buttons {\n    margin-top: 0;\n    margin-bottom: 0;\n}\n```\n\nIs this really so **needed** to fix in webshims?\n"

        "body": "Unfortunatley, I have not so much time to answer it how I want. Here are some points: I'm not 100% sure, wether I will do an absolute new version with new API, but if I do, here are some thoughts:\n1. Drop jQuery and Modernizr\n2. Drop IE8 Support\n3. Use defineProperty  instead of  the current solution $.prop proxying \n4. MutationObserver (and other techniques) instead of the current solution $.updatePolyfill, $.appendPolyfill\n5. Development and documentation have to be done parallel\n\nAbout your two other points, I'm not 100% sure, what you want here, especially your second point. You say for example: \"I dont need to dynamically load my shims over the internet.\" What do you mean here exactly? Comming from capability based loading. We always want to / have to conditionally load script A for device y and load script B for device x. How would adopting commonjs/AMD/UMD change this exactly? How would a project setup look like? Actually I want to create a selfcontained library without any dependencies, so only UMD would be possible.\n\nThere is a common request to only have those files and code needed in the project, which are indeed used. I will setup a github repo with a new file/directory structure in the future. But I might make this atomic inside of the project setup, I don't know wether I would expose this on the build site. I know, that some people see this as an overhead, but actually I packed those features into reasonable groups. The filesize overhead is considered and tested as mostly irrelevant. Additionally if I still want to be able of conditionally loading things, I have to thing about the amount of initial requests. A lot of features like fieldset[disabled] are especially important for building complex forms with conditionally validating fields depending on the checkedness/selectedness of an option/radiobutton/checkbox... It's just good, that it is part of the standard form features. People just need to know about this and how to use it.\n\nOne thing that I really still want to have in next version is the separation of polyfill <-> extension on the one hand and the UI <-> and API on the other hand in conjunction with a conditionally and deferred loading system. \n\nHere is one small example: If you load the following site http://afarkas.github.io/webshim/demos/demos/mediaelement/responsive-mediaelement.html with a modern desktop browser, you will see something like this in your network panel:\n\n![modern](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/188254/2840578/f884b916-d057-11e3-9d25-70205a77c664.png)\nAs you see, webshim will load 9 files with total of 38kb. If you compare this to a solution like videojs just 1file with 20kb) you would think, \"oh my god\". \n\nThe filesize difference of 38kb vs 20 is mainly because of 3 things:\n1. webshims already includes more features like youtube or the full textTrack API\n2. webshims extends the native API with all features (needs more code to be 100% accurate)\n3. some boilerplate code mainly dom-extend.js\n\nBut if you look deeper, how those things are loaded you will see, that webshim has only loaded about 8kb initially and the rest is deferred mostly after the onload event. Although those files are deferred, the UI for the user looks \"fully ready\" and the API is fully implemented with the 9kb.\n\nBut if you use a smartphone to load the exact same page, you will get the following picture in your network panel:\n\n![smarthphone](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/188254/2840726/cbe38c86-d05a-11e3-916e-55067adecb36.png)\n\nAs you see, we now only load 4.5kb initially to have a full unified API for HTML5, flash and youtube.\n\nAnd if I would use the same setup, but wouldn't have a video element on the site the loading of features would also adopt to this scenario.\n\nThis is one great thing about webshim among others, because a developer just don't has to care about lazy loading or conditionally loading, webshim automatically does this for him. So I can implement larger feature sets without slowing down the network performance and a developer simply can use those features.\n"

        "body": "Good idea, I made some progress by just changing the order of the `fill_in`:\n\n```\n    visit '/some/web/page'\n    fill_in \"user_password\", :with => 'password'\n    fill_in \"user_password_confirmation\", :with => 'different_password'\n    fill_in \"user_name\", :with => 'username'\n    click_button \"submit\"\n```\n\nThis makes the `password_confirmation` field blur and trigger the change event, because the `user_name` is filled in last (and filling in the field adds some ms so I suspect webshim has enough time to validate the inputs).\n\nBut now comes the weird part: I run a few tests, sometimes it worked, sometimes webshim was again skipped. It was totally weird, until I discovered: it depends on whether the browser has focus or not during the test run!\n\nSo when I start the test from my console, the browser opens a few seconds later and I manually focus the browser, then everything works.\n\nIf I do not focus the browser window and it is in the background (I stay in my console), it does not work. And it does not depend on whether I delay the tests after filling in the inputs or not. Even after sleeping 5 seconds webshim does not kick in.\n\nI even did the two tests in a row with a 5 second sleep between them:\n\n```\n    visit '/some/web/page'\n    fill_in \"user_password\", :with => 'password'\n    fill_in \"user_password_confirmation\", :with => 'different_password'\n    fill_in \"user_name\", :with => 'username'\n    click_button \"submit\"\n\n    sleep 5\n\n    visit '/some/web/page'\n    fill_in \"user_password\", :with => 'password'\n    fill_in \"user_password_confirmation\", :with => 'different_password'\n    fill_in \"user_name\", :with => 'username'\n    click_button \"submit\"\n```\n\nSo the browser pops up, I do not focus it, it does the first click and webshim does not prevent it, then it sleeps 5 seconds during which I have time to focus the window, and then with the same test but with browser focue webshim kicks in and it works. If I do not focus the browser during that period of time, the second tests fails, too.\n\nI repeated if 20 times or so with expected results.\n\nFirst I thought about these two possibilities:\n- webshim has some sort of optimization to detect whether the browser window has focus or not and sleeps if it has not?\n- maybe my OS (OSX 10.9) somehow limits background programs in a way and therefore some javascript does not execute correctly? [App Nap](https://www.apple.com/osx/advanced-technologies/) (second topic)?\n\nBut I traced it down to: The `blur` event is not triggered when the browser is in background! And it looks webshims depends on it to validate the password confirmation.\n\n```\n$(function() {\n      # this shows only an alert when browser has focus\n      $('input').on('blur', function() {\n          alert('blur');\n      });\n});\n```\n\nSo when `selenium` fills in the fields when the browser is in the background, no `blur` is triggered. (The same goes for `focus` btw., maybe other events, too)\n\nIs this a browser/firefox bug? Or is this how it should be?\n"

        "body": "wow, great write-up, thanks Alexander! I'll add notes inline to hopefully clarify some of the things I mentioned.\n\n> Drop jQuery and Modernizr\n> Drop IE8 Support\n> Use defineProperty instead of the current solution $.prop proxying\n> MutationObserver (and other techniques) instead of the current \n>     solution $.updatePolyfill,  $.appendPolyfill\n> Development and documentation have to be done parallel\n\nAll great ideas IMO! :)\n\n>  \"I dont need to dynamically load my shims over the internet.\" What do you mean here \n\nwebshim expects to load things at run time, based on the capabilities of the browser. This is complicated in production, where the code goes through an optimization pipleine (minification, serving assets from a CDN, etc.) \n\nIn my experience, the most heavy use of bandwidth on production sites (desktop and mobile) are images. 2-3 images on a page outweigh all of the combined, minified, compressed javascript by a lot. Because of this, I think serving optimized code bundles for my specific user agent is overkill.  The download time difference isn't that significant because the \"elephant in the room\" are the images. It results in much simpler run time logic. It might even be more performant to have a bundled pile of javascript code that is fetched all at once, rather than load, check capabilities, and load the rest. It means 1 request instead of having to do 2 in series. \n\n> How would adopting commonjs/AMD/UMD change this exactly?\n\nI'd prefer that any polyfill doesn't declare its own module loading strategy, and instead uses the facilities in the project. This differs from project to project. I've worked on some projects that use requireJS, some that use browserify, and on the old fashioned javascript code that puts everything in the global namespace. They pretty much all have their own loading strategy, but webshim defines it's own. I think removing this would ease integration and simplify the project architecture.\n\n> How would a project setup look like?\n\nI'd love to see webshim split into several (perhaps dozens) of tiny modules. Each would be responsible for doing just one thing, and would be published on npm. They'd use UMD, so regardless of whether your project is commonjs, amd, or window globals, the modules would be usable and interoperable.\n\nThe first step would be figuring out how to decompose webshim into these small pieces. For example, could form support be split up? If I wanted to only shim the required attribute on form elements, perhaps that could be one module. Perhaps the pattern attribute could be another module. Maybe both of those modules rely on several other common modules related to form checking/processing. The nice thing about this approach is you can pick and choose various pieces of webshim and include only the features relevant to your app. It suspect it would also make maintaining the app easier because small modules that do one thing are much easier to replace, improve, document, etc.\n"

        "body": "@mreinstein time was definitely an issue with my first tries, too (where the password validation was filled in last), but still even with those sleeps it does not work when the browser window is not focused:\n\n```\nvisit '/some/web/page'\nsleep 1 # <-- wait one second\nfill_in \"user_password\", :with => 'password'\nsleep 1\nfill_in \"user_password_confirmation\", :with => 'different_password'\nsleep 1\nfill_in \"user_name\", :with => 'username'\nsleep 1\nclick_button \"submit\"\n```\n\nIt simply looks like the `blur` event is not thrown and webshim cannot react on it. When I trigger it manually:\n\n```\nvisit '/some/web/page'\nfill_in \"user_password\", :with => 'password'\nfill_in \"user_password_confirmation\", :with => 'different_password'\nfill_in \"user_name\", :with => 'username'\n\npage.execute_script '$(\"input\").trigger(\"blur\");'\n\nclick_button \"submit\"\n```\n\nIt works, even without any wait time and when the browser is not focused.\n\nLater I'll spin up some virtual machines to see whether this problem exists solely on OSX, you can test by yourself in the fiddle http://fiddle.jshell.net/WPpPy/30/ whether `blur` works without focus - I'm not sure what the correct behavior should be, but atm I think browser's javascript should not behave differently whether the window is focused or not. I'll contact the browser vendors, too, maybe they can explain it and maybe there is a thought behind it.\n\nAt least it looks like this all is not a bug in webshim ;-)\n"

        "body": "I did some more testing, and IE 11 and FF on windows 8.1 do not trigger the `blur` event, either, when the window is not focused. So only Safari always triggers the `blur` event.\n\nBut I think I got the reason behind all this is: If the browser is not focused, you cannot focus an input with `$('input').focus();`. If the input is not focused, an `$('input').blur();` cannot blur it, so no blur event is triggered. Only our new IE 6 (Safari) behaves differently and always triggers the event, even if the input wasn't really focused or blurred. See http://fiddle.jshell.net/WPpPy/34/ for testing.\n\nA workaround for the testing framework might be to trigger the events with `$('input').trigger('focus')` etc. - or the browser simply must stay focused during the test run.\n"

The HTML 'accept' attribute doesn't appear to work, it will allow selection of any file and it doesn't filter the filedialog box to your desired file types, it just doesn't take the file into the input element even if a valid file type is selected. It seems to accept any old file and the HTML element is blank?\n\nThis is especially annoying as, if like me, you are displaying file details, the onchange event is fired even though technically the content hasn't changed and an invalid file is selected.\n\n(4). Passing in filereader options for locking down file types doesn't appear work either...\n\nE.G.\n            'filereader':{\n                        label: 'Only PDF and Word documents allowed (_.pdf, *.doc, *.docx)',\n                        extensions: '_.pdf;_.doc;_.docx',\n                        debugMode: true  \n                    }\n\nThis doesn't make any difference (see point 3).\n"

I don't really understand your usecase for webshims here. Most people want to see what the webshim work is, if they implement webshims. Additionally, they do use a modern browser to do the first test. So it's most likley, they want to see, how the polyfills look like and not how the native implementation is looking like.\n\nI have added an enhance switch to some of my demos, which showcases the different states of \"enhancements\". Here is a simple demo for this:\nhttp://afarkas.github.io/webshim/demos/demos/mediaelement/track-demo.html\n\nOr here is another example:\nhttp://afarkas.github.io/webshim/demos/demos/webforms/datalist-experiment.html\n"

        "body": "Wow, nice!!!\n\nI haven't looked into all your research, but will do this. It's great, thank you. \n\nAbout your Android research regarding that Andorid seems to support input widgets. You are partially right here and what webshims is doing with Andorid is: If Andorid is detected and this browser does not support progress element and fieldset disabled, webshims assumes, that input widgets are not implemented right, even if Modernizr is reporting, that this input is implemented (see also here: https://github.com/Modernizr/Modernizr/issues/769). The reason for this is quite simple: I also made a lot of tests with a lot of Android versions and the result is heavy to got this 100% right. Some versions got it right and some had some problems. Additionally not only the version but also the manufacturer of the smarthpone had influence. The problems were: 1. Datepicker does not offer a clear button/UI, 2. datepicker enters the value in wrong format (some do not add leading zeros, some other use format of OS configuration instead of yyyy-mm-dd), 3. some version do neither trigger blur nor change (Note: I implement missing change event in iOS and others, if at least blur is working) and 4. on older versions not even a datepicker is shown.\n\nThis said, while webshims way to handle this is indeed not very \"distinctive\"/\"precise\", it is a) fail proof and b) future orientated, if a future version of andorid has those named features (progress element and fieldset[disabled] it will also only use the Modernizr tests. And I think I'm right here, because beginning form Andorid 4.4 the input widgets shouldn't be replaced on Andorid anymore by webshims. With other words: Although webshims could be work more granular with older Android versions, you should not remove it, I had my reasons for this!\n\nAbout your two concrete issues:\n**`splitInput`**\nThis splitInput feature uses scripted focusing, which can't be done on all devices. My question here: Does this feature not exist or does it something strange and bad with the UI/UX. (I can't fix, that it does not work, but I can fix, that there are not other side effects.)\n\n**`datalist`**\nWill look into this and fix as soon as possible\n"

        "body": "Thanks for the quick response, I think you are definitely right about the Android browser just behaving terribly in this case. \n- I am not too concerned with the `splitInput`, the Android browser simply cannot cope with any kind of auto tabbing. I can just use the native input or even use the webshim 3 dropdown date version if necessary. You may just want to make a note about it's bugginess for Android in the docs.\n- The `datalist` is my main concern because neither the native or webshim version works on Android. I will have to stick with jQuery UI Autocomplete for this until either webshim works here or Android browsers support the datalist.\n\nAs a side question, you may have noticed I also tested a type of input I call a Numeric Code. Such as a number only postcode, PIN or Credit Card number. For this type of input it makes sense to use text fields on desktops where the maxlength and pattern validation come into play and number fields on touch devices where you get the numeric keypad. The number field implementation of webshim is not helpful here because none of the features like grouping or stepper are needed and the maxlength is not carried through. \n- Actual question: Is there a way to disable webshim polyfill on a specific input? I know you can choose to only implement certain types of form-ext, but the only way I could turn it off for one specific input it in this case was to use input type:text and change to type:number with JS after webshim has already run.\n"

Chrome is working to get this feature soon into Chrome for Android. You should not turn it into type=\"number\", because some browsers will remove leading zeros and other stupid things.\n\nAs a workaround you could detect, wether inputmode is supported and if not replace it with type \"tel\", it's also semantically wrong, but won't have so much side effects. \n\nThis said I will also add a new class called `ws-noreplace` with next release.\n"

I will have to do some more testing when I am back at work on Monday, but most likely my sample page was not correct somehow.\n\nAs for the IE8 validation, the reason I did not bring it up is that I had a feeling it was a local issue. I had someone else test it on like 2 levels of citrix login so I have a strong suspicion something wasn't right there. I will check this again too and let you know.\n\nI am keen to keep that UX analysis spreadsheet up to date and will likely add the time and month input too.\n\nThanks once again for all your help and work. Webshim is seriously one of the best tools for anyone building online forms period.\n"

The datalist does indeed work on Android 4.3, not sure exactly what I was doing wrong, adding `customDatalist: true` seemed to help. My solution therefore is to polyfill 'forms' on Android browsers and 'forms' and 'forms-ext' on all other browsers, I still don't want webshims overriding the Android inputs 4.3+ supports. Android behavior for these inputs is inconsistent though, thankfully in my case I do not have to support older versions/devices. \n2. Also after double checking the validation on IE8 it is working. I was also missing `addValidators: true`.\n\nI also had a look into the `inputmode=\"numeric` property you suggested for the Numeric Code inputs. Currently none of the browsers support it (not even iOS), I am happy with my implementation because it solves all the UI issues and none of the browsers I tested prohibited leading zeroes. Your inclusion of the `ws-noreplace` class will make this even easier.\n\nSo that concludes this round of my analysis. Websims is (one way or another) solving all my problems and I will begin to implement it into our projects. Thanks again.\n"

        "body": "@aFarkas polyfilling `inputmode` is a great idea. I have a few observations:\n\nKeypads vary wildly!\n- The Google and Samsung 'tel' keyboard allows all sorts of special characters plus spaces. The iOS 'tel' keypad does not allow spaces.\n- The iOS 'number' keypad is just the number part of the regular keypad (you can still change to the alpha keys). The Google 'number' keypad allows numerals, hyphens, spaces and the minus sign only. The Samsung 'number' keypad allows ONLY numerals (which is totally broken because you can't even enter decimals).\n- The number keypad invoked by setting `pattern=\"[0-9]*\"` on iOS is different to both the iOS 'number' and 'tel' keypad. It allows ONLY numerals. this type of keypad is a quirk of iOS, there is nothing in the spec that says this should happen.\n- The above variations are only for the 3 keyboards I checked, you can install hundreds of other 3rd party keyboards on Android and I hear Apple are about to release customized keyboards too!\n\nSo this raises some difficult questions around\n1. What is the semantically correct markup for a Numeric Code input and\n2. What is the implementation on current devices which gives the best User Experience?\n\nI dont think we can make absolute assumptions about the exact nature of a Numeric Code. A PIN number should only have numeric values, a Credit Card might be nicer to separate groups with spaces and hyphens, a Serial number may have brackets or who knows what else. As inputs it is definitely best practice to allow users to enter values in the way they feel comfortable. Given the input is `type=\"text\"` on desktops, the value always needs to go through Server Side cleanup and validation anyway.\n\n_My Proposal_\nLet the developer decide how they want inputmode to be polyfilled.\n- First priority, if `type=\"text\"` and `pattern=\"[0-9]*\"` on iOS, implement the special iOS numeric only keypad.\n- If `type=\"text\"` and the device has custom keypads (ie. modernizer detects 'touch') change the input type to match the `inputmode` specified. (eg. `inputmode=\"numeric\"` changes type to `number`, `inputmode=\"tel\"` changes type to `tel` etc..). This way the developer can decide if their input more closely matches a 'number' or 'tel', perhaps the other types of input modes may need polyfilling in the future too.\n- You will have to keep an eye out for any native support of `inputmode` once browsers/devices do start supporting it you will have to drop the pollyfill. I hope for everyone's sake that when they do, there is a way to detect it!\n"

        "body": "Hi,\n\nI made same observation, but my conclusion is a little bit different here. To sumarize it:\n\ninputmode=\"numeric\" should give us the following charckters: +-.,0123456789\ntype=\"tel\" depends on the device, but there are devices, which will give you only: +0123456789\n\nWhich means a switch between inputmode=\"numeric\" to type=\"tel\" is obtrusive.\nA switch from inputmode=\"numeric\" to type=\"number\" might give you the right keyboard, but there is always the possibility of value sanitatzation, which will change/remove values like: +01231 to 1231 or an empty string. Means that this is also obtrusiv.\nThere is actually no usecase for inputmode=\"tel\" on an input. It's more for a textarea and for the completeness of the spec. \n\nMy current approach is therefore to always look for both: pattern=\"[0-9]+\" and inputmode=\"numeric\" (The first pattern already works on iOS...). Maybe I will improve this to detect things like [0-9]{3,9} and so on and do the fix also on iOS. \n\nYou are right, that sometimes an inputmode=\"numeric\" to type=\"number\" would be better or sometimes also an inputmode=\"numeric\" to type=\"tel\" without an explicit pattern is appreciated by a developer, but those kind of switches are obtrusive and need to be guarded by an option or a specific class/attribute on the element. -> The developer has to explictly opt-in for this + I have to document it somewhere/somehow.\n\nAny suggestions? Maybe:\n\n``` html\n<input inputmode=\"numeric\" data-wsmode=\"tel\" />\n<input inputmode=\"numeric\" data-wsmode=\"number\" />\n```\n\nAbout native support. There is a way to detect it and I'm using this detection already. Interestingly inputMode is already supported on Chrome Desktop. Don't understand why :-D. And on Firefox it is hidden behind a flag: \"dom.forms.inputmode\" + something different/similiar \"dom.mozInputMethod.enabled\"\n"

        "body": "Seems messy to me, if you want to add another attribute like `data-wsmode` to change input type on devices then why bother tying that with `inputmode` or `pattern` at all? \n\nLooking at the [spec for inputmode](http://www.whatwg.org/specs/web-apps/current-work/multipage/association-of-controls-and-forms.html#attr-fe-inputmode) it says that the intent of this property is to specify what type of input mechinism would be most usefull, ie. which keypad to use without effecting the `type` or sanitization properties. However as we know that is not possible on any any current device. Polyfilling from `inputmode` directly to `type` I would think is a clean and neat way to solve the problem as the inputmodes in the spec map 1 to 1 to the different types and keyboards. This puts control entirely in the developer's hands without any need for custom attributes and if they don't want to use the polyfill (and any sanitation that implies) they simply omit `inputmode`. Once `inputmode` is properly supported on that device you simply drop the polyfill.\n\nThe only odd behavior then is the iOS pattern numeric keypad, which is Apple's attempt to implement `inputmode` before it was in the spec. Given the only way to enable this keyboard is with `pattern=\"[0-9]*\"`, you should probably not polyfill `inputmode` on iOS when that pattern is present. \n"

All other examples show how `inputmode=\"numeric\"` is polyfilled. In summary: On Android and iPad inputmode is always polyfilled and on iPhone, the developer has to add a pattern. While iOS only detects `[0-9]*` and `\\d*`, webshim will detect more (but not all suiteable) patterns.\n\nI think this is the best way to do this automatic. As already said, in some situations, there might be a better different approach, but those approaches are obtrusive and needs to be hidden behind a configuration.

        "body": "IRT @mreinstein 's clarification, I'd just like to sat that, although I use nodejs for my own work, I prefer that Webshim NOT _require_ npm.  Not all web developers are willing/able to use Node, and it would be difficult to sell Webshim to those folks.  Part of what makes Webshim so great is that a developer can just download and extract the ZIP, include polyfiller.js, and write a single webshim.polyfill() cal to include what they need on a page.  Anything more complicated than that discourages the noobs and reduces the Webshim audience.\n\nWhile I'm chiming in, I'd also like Webshim to _never_ drop support for IE6 or any outdated browser.  The whole point of a polyfill is support the dinosaurs.  It might be ideal to add an _option_ that specifies which browsers to support, but I feel that the default should be to go back as far as possible.\n"

Those kind of polyfills work good, but you have to respect one thing, you should add them blocking right after your CSS or at least with `document.write` everything else, is a) bad for performance (because it causes unnecessary reflows/repaints) and b) create FOCUs.\n\nI think with current browser landscape, it's easy to add them with a conditional comment.\n"

I think the right way to do this is to do something like jquery does; keep older browser support in 1.x, and have a leaner 2.x branch that supports newer browsers but is much smaller.\n\n> The whole point of a polyfill is support the dinosaurs.\n\nThe purpose of polyfilling is to support a feature using the native specification for **whatever browsers your audience uses.**\n"

My problem with this approach is two-fold:\n1. it re-invents a module format that is similar to an existing pattern (requirejs/amd)\n2. it's dictating how my apps load. webshim works great if I don't use requirejs or browserify, etc. But if I do use those module loading strategies, I now have to deal with webshim's separate loader. Makes things like optimization tough. \n\nI'm not the maintainer and it's not my call but I want to see webshim move away from being a large monolithic package. It's designed the way jquery was 8 years ago. Not to say that's bad, but we shouldn't build apps that way any more. Things like es6 module loading/browserify/requirejs are a testament to this.  I want this library to remain relevant into the future and I think this simplication/modularization is one way to make the package more useful in modern web development.\n\nWebshim is an amazing polyfill library, but it's value comes from the quality of the polyfills, **not** the plumbing it uses to load itself into memory. I want to see a way to modularize it into small, re-usable pieces, each of which do one thing well.\n"

Most task-specific polyfills that I've encountered require a lot of configuration or at least a lot of separate scripts and links to load.  The beautiful thing about Webshim is that it requires only one script (in addition to its dependencies on modernizr/jquery) and one single JS command (webshim.polyfill()) and you're done.\n\nNow, under the covers, I'm not opposed to allowing different loader modules and other low-level customizations, and I'm also not opposed to allowing power users to select which Webshim polyfills to include in their own projects, and to decide how to include them.  I also support the notion that Webshim have a little of logic to detect if a loader is already present, and use the appropriate mechanism to use or load its own, and even to load modernizr.js and/or jquery.js if needed.\n"

        "body": "Something I can not resist: Although the current webshim-repo is treated as a monolithic package, the architecture isn't and webshim 1.x is developed with modules in mind. Webshim doesn't use amd or commonjs as a module format, because normal optimization tools for those module formats are extremly bad if it comes to capability based/conditionlally loading. This is something you can't blame webshim for. It's a tool problem. Develope in small pieces and then concat everything into one big file is just a bad performance workaround by most build systems. I think webpack seems intersting here, but as you said, webshim should not force a developer to use certain tools, it should simply work. In fact es6 packages are another \"workaround\" for the es6 modules performance problem, but would be better suited for webshim, because they can work much more like a combohandler service (which is the way, how optimizing webshim would work best). By the way jsdeliver supports combohandling and it would be intersting to create a polyfiller.js which would support it.\n\nThis means, I invented a different format, because it's much simpler to pre-optimize it. You are right webshim dictates some loading strategies, but this doesn't mean, that it doesn't work with amd/commonjs, it's simply just works side by side. And it works better how it is done now, than leaving it to the normal r.js optimizer for example.\n\nAs a small pro tipp: There are files in webshim depending on feature and/or configuration, which are not loaded conditionally and don't need to be loaded deferred. For example: If you use `mediaelement`  feature you can simply directly include or require 'mediaelement-core' and 'swfimini'. In case you are using the `froms` feature you can directly include 'form-core'. There are some other files, depending on your configuation (especially with `replaceUI: true` and `customMessages: true`). You can have a look in [optimize-polyfiller.js](https://github.com/aFarkas/webshim/blob/gh-pages/grunt-tasks/optimize-polyfiller.js). If you do this, those files are going into your normal \"optimization pipline\", which can give you indeed a speed boost (if the optimization is done well), but all other files are better handled by the predefined webshim way.\n"

Just wanted to collect some thoughts on what a 2.x _could_ look like, and give feedback on what I'd personally love to see from my own selfish perspective. :)\n\n> webshim 1.x is developed with modules in mind\n\nIt was also developed before there was a viable mainstream module system. Now that there are several (es6 modules, commonjs, amd) would you consider moving to one/some of those? requirejs is already very similar to your strategy.\n\n>  This is something you can't blame webshim for.\n\nI definitely don't mean to imply any blame, at all. Webshim was created before several of these semi-standards were developed. I think it's a really clever system. \n\n> Develop in small pieces and then concat everything into one big file is just a bad \n> performance workaround by most build systems\n\nI used to think that too, which is why requirejs/AMD seemed more appealing at first. The idea that my dependencies load at run time as needed is appealing on the surface. But for most production web sites, the total download of images dwarfs the javascript payload. Having a fancy dependency loader that pulls in modules at runtime is overkill when a site has 600kb of image data and 40kb of compressed, minified javascript. In that case, it's far better to just load the extra data up front, even if half of it (20kb?) isn't even used.\n\n> but this doesn't mean, that it doesn't work with amd/commonjs, it's simply just works side by side.\n> And it works better how it is done now, than leaving it to the normal r.js optimizer for example.\n\nyes, r.js is a pain, but don't you think having to deal with 2 side-by-side loader strategies is kind of painful? Webshim's loader is well designed but I still have to deal with it, and it's solving a problem that I don't have. I don't need all of that infrastructure to conditionally load 40kb of javascript, even on a mobile experience. requirejs and webshim both have opinions about the best loading strategy and I just have to live with them or rip out the guts to work with my stuff.\n"

Then I configure the webshims global through a \nsequence of setOptions(\u2026), activeLang(\u2026) and polyfill(\u2026).\n\nBest,\n\n## \n\nChristophe Porteneuve\ntdd@tddsworld.com\n"

In case you don't need live validation and only want to check validity on submit and if value becomes valid you can change the `events` option of the iVal feature. Here is [another demo](http://jsfiddle.net/trixta/6jpxpm5e/). You can also change the styling to make them appear similiar to tooltips (i.e.: position absolute), but in most cases you don't want to do this, because this might interfere with your normal styles.\n"

You will see, that IE and Safari, which are using the webshim implementation do support minlength.\n\nCurrently no browser has an implementation of this property and therefore I don't force this implementation.\n\nYou can simply use the `pattern` attribute to get the minlength validation:\n\n```\n<input pattern=\".{3,}\" required title=\"3 characters minimum\" />\n```\n\nIf you really need the minlength validation using the minlength attribute, you still have two other options:\n1. set [`addValidators` to true](http://afarkas.github.io/webshim/demos/demos/forms.html#Custom-validity)\n\n```\nwebshim.setOptions('forms', { addValidators: true });\n```\n1. Or set `webshim.bugs.bustedValidity`to true:\n\n```\nwebshim.bugs.bustedValidity = !('minLength' in document.createElement('input'));\n```\n\nI would prefer the `pattern-attribute`solution until neither chrome nor firefox has implemented this property.\n"

I wish it wasn\u2019t needed, but am so glad it exists.\n\nI must admit the date widget seems a bit odd, it seems to appear in the opposite place the most available space is and I also can\u2019t work out how you stop it starting on the \u2018year\u2019 dimension when first opening, I want it to zoom in to the date value already set in the control.\n\nAre there docs for each of the actual widgets and their settings or is this simply not possible with the date / calendar widget?\n\nKind regards,\n\nCraig Chant (Dip Comp)\nInformation Technology Manager\n\n[HLP_IT_Sig1]\n\n   Direct Line: 01903 22 77 53        Main Line: 01903 602 664       Website: www.homeloanpartnership.comhttp://www.homeloanpartnership.com/\n\n[cid:image007.jpg@01CFBD4B.DA0066D0]\n\nFrom: Alexander Farkas [mailto:notifications@github.com]\nSent: 21 August 2014 14:05\nTo: aFarkas/webshim\nCc: Craig Chant\nSubject: Re: [webshim] No forms-ext extensions at all on IE, regardless of version and settings (#409)\n\n@homeloanhttps://github.com/homeloan\n\nThx, from your description the dev version already give you two bugs:\n1.  this is just a formal warning: need to load forms feature to use forms-ext feature.\n\nAnd can be fixed by writing:\n\nwebshim.polyfill('forms-ext');\n1.

There definitely is some case of \nform-core + combos, on Chrome.\n\nMy app is built with Brunch, using CommonJS wrapping.  As this may have \nsomething to do with it (although I fail to see why it would), I kept it \nthat way, but provided two dirs in the enclosed Zip:\n- `brunch` is the \"app source\", in case you want to quickly check out \n  individual modules, tweak them and rebuild, or whatever.  Just `npm \n  install` in it to get it up and running, then `npm run build` when you \n  need to.\n- `public` is the built app.  I put an `index.html` in there that loads \n  as my app does, and also contains the results from my tests this morning \n  on all the platforms I need, for you to see.  You just need to serve \n  that directory as HTTP, be it through Rack, Pow, SimpleHTTPServer or \n  what have you :-)\n\nI hope this helps,\n\nBest,\n\n## \n\nChristophe Porteneuve\ntdd@tddsworld.com\n"

I think it's working fine.The list of loaded files shows, that the right combo and non-combo mix of files are loaded. \n\nI don't believe that the red/bold marked aren't always loaded. For example, Chrome load form-core.js (bold, sometimes) and form-validation.js always, can't be true, because form-validation is referenced only in form-core.js so form-core has to be loaded.\n\nI think the dev tools weren't showing the hole picture in your case.\n\nThe only thing, that I saw, is that brunch has destroyed detection of the currentScript script detection (i.e.: finding the right basePath) automatically, but you are already configuring it manually, so this shouldn't be a problem.\n\nHave you encountered any issues in your app?\n"

Which is why I went to this length of trials :-)\n\nAs for the notice: yes, it's something I had to patch in my own app: \nyour script incorrectly detects that basePath is not configured at one \npoint, and reports on it even when I provide the info.  If you look at \nthe source line for it, you'll see the condition doesn't cover all \nconfig possibilities for it.\n\nBest,\n\n## \n\nChristophe Porteneuve\ntdd@tddsworld.com\n"

But this isn't the case.\n\nAbout the detection: This detection has to be handeld right away, it can not be handeld if polyfill/configuration starts, because this could be inside of a callback and this destroys the test. It simply runs and if you configure it after everything is ok.\n\nAnd yes, I do not test, wether you are setting it, because this part is only inside of the dev-folder, which shouldn't be used in production. I only added it to inform you and me, that there is something happening wrong in my script (Actually, I have partially fixed it https://github.com/aFarkas/webshim/commit/c192d4049f9f7af5d11e830e8b935b9d292c0e6e), but due to the fact, that brunch is calling this code inside of a callback, which can be async, the detection won't work in all browsers).

Calling native methods:\n   This is explained here: http://afarkas.github.io/webshim/demos/index.html#Guide-dom-abstractions\n   This means either you use a):\n\n``` js\n$(this).setCustomValidity('message'); // instead of this.setCustomValidity('message');\n```\n\nor b) you use:\n\n``` js\nwebshim.setOptions('extendNative', true);\n```\n\nAlthough option a) is an abstraction I would use a).\n1. Use $.on instead of inline handlers\n\nA fiddle, that shows the code changes is here:\nhttp://jsfiddle.net/trixta/x84bar07/6/\n\n---\n\nBut there are still some errors about your code: \n1. setCustomValidity and 2. code style.\n\nAbout setCustomValidity:\n1. setCustomValidity\na) If you don't use noValidate on your form you need to call it initially (in case it is prefilled) and on input or at least on change\nb) Writing interoberable setCustomValidity code isn't easy. Although you only use one setCustomValidity you always should \"guard\" your calls to not override another setCustomValidity call.\nc) What happens with your code, if someone has used the right password in the second field and adjust the first field? (i.e.: You have to test also a change in the first field)\nd) Especially in case of passwords, a passwordmanager could hook in and there is no input or change event\n1. Code style:\n   Try to create re-usable components, you can do this, by creating hooks inside of your markup.\n\n``` html\n<input data-repeat=\"password\" data-repeat-message=\"The two passwords must match.\" />\n```\n\nHere is a fiddle that, trys to meet every points. (But not 2. d)):\nhttp://jsfiddle.net/trixta/x84bar07/10/\n\nLast but not least, webshim comes with some customValidators, which makes this quite easy:\nhttp://jsfiddle.net/trixta/Ev5G4/light/\n\nPlease let me know wether this helps.\n"

I think first version will be there in 6 month.\n\nThis said, webshim doesn't really add much complexity. The only problem I know of is, that there are cm systems messing around with URLs. And to be clear, those systems often have workarounds or exceptions for the most often used relative asset referencing and loading (i.e.: loading background images from a stylesheet). Those systems do not work with amd modules either, if the modules aren't pre-packaged by another build system. \n\nTo be clear here, it's quite annoying and a big fail by those \"systems\" every web standard that needs to load assets uses relative referencing i.e. it is built upon this standard. And if you think on ES6 modules or HTML imports you know, that there are comming new standards involving asset loading. \n"

See here a demo: http://jsfiddle.net/trixta/h249hhyx/.\n\nNormally this happens, if an invalid field is hidden and the invalid event isn't handeld. (i.e. `event.preventDefault()`). Webshim normally automatically handles the invalid event, if a form field was hidden by webshim.\n\nAlthough this is no fix. You can use [`replaceValidationUI`](http://afarkas.github.io/webshim/demos/demos/forms.html#UI-replaceValidationUI) or [`iVal`](http://afarkas.github.io/webshim/demos/demos/forms.html#UI-ival) to tell webshim to handle all invalids.\n\nCan you provide a testcase or does the explanation help you?\n"

I already test \"calculateWidth\": false ;-)  but like you said i must search outside webshims context, i mean in my css probably because if i do this: \n\n#headline #usrnewads input, textarea {width: 90%; ... instead of width: 100%; i don't have the troubles and it show perfectly on my old samsung galaxy...  It's like input css settings have something wrong.\n\nReduce width is probably not the \"cleaner solution\" but in waiting of other css investigations..\n\nYep! I saw this magnifique example /demos/webforms/ just perfect :-)\n\nIn my pages, I put only these lines just before the /head:\ncode.jquery.com/jquery-1.11.0.min.js script\ncdn.jsdelivr.net/webshim/1.14.5/polyfiller.js script\nand call webshims.polyfill('forms forms-ext');\n\nThe result is perfect; on Google Chrome i keep the original date and time widget; FireFox is able now to show the date and time picker as well; my old Samsung Galaxy have now the same behavior than FireFox.\n\nI also try to keep my documents in full html5 like this:\n(i mean no other w3 declarations)\n!doctype html\nhtml lang=\"fr\"\nhead\nmeta charset=\"utf-8\"\n...\n\nI noticed that  /demos/webforms/ document have this setting:\n!DOCTYPE html\nhtml xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" xml:lang=\"en\" lang=\"en\"\nhead\nmeta charset=\"utf-8\"/\n...\n\nDo you think i'm on the right way ?

Inputs of type \"text\" will get their placeholders as expected but not the ones with type \"number\". Validations and showing error messages are working as expected.\n\nOne more thing: when I inspect the input element at http://afarkas.github.io/webshim/demos/demos/cfgs/input-number.html#placeholder=yo+number it is of type \"text\", not \"number\" (also in Chrome). This seems odd to me...\n"

Seperate jquery + polyfiller.js + your polyfiller initialization code (options + polyfill call) from the rest of your JS and include this package directly in your HTML with a higher priority.\n2. make sure to not call `polyfill` after domready, call it as soon as possible\n3. inline the scripts, which are always downloaded. (you can use this grunt-task: https://github.com/aFarkas/webshim/blob/gh-pages/grunt-tasks/optimize-polyfiller.js (note you can only build from dev not from minified) or you can use this builder: http://afarkas.github.io/webshim/demos/demos/cfgs/builder.html (those tasks give you a new polyfiller.js)\n4. in case you are not using JS apis but only markup apis set `webshim.setOptions('waitReady', false);`\n5. keep in mind `onload` event means nothing to perceived performance\n"

        "body": "> The only problem I know of is, that there are cm systems messing around with URLs. And to be clear, those systems often have workarounds or exceptions for the most often used relative asset referencing and loading (i.e.: loading background images from a stylesheet).\n\nCM systems usually do that for a reason like far future caching, which is best practice imo and I doubt, that this will change anytime soon. Relative asset loading from js and css is a little bit different. Scripts may quite easily and safely manipulate URLs in stylesheets (which are in 99% of the cases background-image-urls and fonts), while manipulating JS-Files is \nmuch more complex and in some cases impossible (as they may be created dynamically from different variables).\n\nEven with future technologies like http2 in mind, I'd still prefer a system, where everything is served as one package (which may optionally be custom built with npm locally or on the server). It might not be a perfect solution as some js is served, which is never used, but I strongly doubt, that further optimizing it (and loading from the client side only the necessary parts) is worth the inflexibility/limitations.\n\nBtw, how many well-established libraries like jQuery have conditional loaders? They are usually not customized at all, as the performance impact is so negligible.\n"

        "body": "Thanks to your consideration.\n\nAbout your solution:\nThis solution is good when we have used &lt;fieldset&gt; as a group wrapper.\nSometimes we need to arrange some input elements around the page as a semantic group.\nIn other hand maybe we have a page with 2 or more submit button; One for main submission logic, one for cancelling purpose, one for checking some situation on server, one for redirecting to another page and ....\nEvery button has own validation logic.\n\nI had written JavaScript for solving these situations but I think this approach is not good enough.\nWhen I start new Application, I should deliver all JS files from old apps to new one but webshim is an integrated solution.\n\nAbout ASP.NET:\nNowadays ASP.NET has 3 different development approaches:\n1. <b>ASP.NET Web Forms</b>, Component Oriented, State-full, Event Driven, ...\n2. <b>ASP.NET Web Pages</b>, Exactly Like [Classic ASP] or [PHP] but based on .NET Framework\n3. <b>ASP.NET MVC</b>, Like  [ASP.NET Web Pages] but constrained to follow MVC architectural pattern. \n\nAbout ASP.NET Web Forms:\nASP.NET Web Form is a great technology for Rapid Application Development (RAD).\nDevelopers just need to know a little about HTML,CSS,JS. Every things you need to build Data-Centric web apps is available and you just need to wire components to each other by Server-Codes to making great apps! Just like implementing an custom electronic circuit by wiring some ICs.\nIts architecture back to 2001 when this technology was presented. (IE 6 and HTML 4 era)\n\nI know this sounds ridiculous, Developing Web Apps without knowing HTML or without following W3C standards. But ASP.NET Web Forms follows standards itself in its engine, so developer just need to know Server components purpose and behaviors.\n\nTo implementing forms we use <b>&lt;asp:TextBox&gt;</b> and <b>&lt;asp:Button&gt;</b>. ASP.NET Web Form engine render those as <b>&lt;input type='text'&gt;</b> and <b>&lt;input type='submit'&gt;</b>. In ASP.NET Web Forms there is a mechanism to grouping inputs, buttons and validator components for doing custom validation.\n\nSample:\n<code>&lt;asp:TextBox ID='txt1' ValidationGroup='groupName'&gt;</code>\n<code>&lt;asp:TextBox ID='txt2' &gt;</code>\n<code>&lt;asp:Button ID='btn1' OnClick='btn1_Click' ValidationGroup='groupName'&gt;</code>\n<code>&lt;asp:Button ID='btn2' OnClick='btn2_Click' &gt;</code>\n<code>&lt;asp:RequierdFieldValidator ... TargetControlID='txt1'  ValidationGroup='groupName'&gt;\n</code>\n\nWhen end-user clicks on <b>btn1</b>, some injected JavaScript codes will run to check just <b>txt1</b> emptiness; if it is filled, form will be submit and on server there is a C#/VB method (btn1_Click) that process the form (developer codes that).\nWhen end-user clicks on <b>btn2</b>, form will be submit without doing validation and on server method (btn2_Click) will process the form.\n\nI remind again, this approach was presented on HTML 4 era!\nToday Microsoft did not change/update this mechanism because of compatibility concerns!\nThis mechanism injects huge JavaScript Codes to validate forms and as I said before is not bootstrap friendly.\n\nAfter all:\nI think, my request, can be a flexibility point for webshim if it supports custom validation situations without writing JavaScript.\nIf you do not agree to me, I respect.\nI apologize for verbosity over this post.\nGood luck!\n"

        "body": "You can also easily change my solution to anything you want. Here is an example using using your `data-validation-group` attribute:\n\n``` html\n<form novalidate=\"\" class=\"ws-validate\">\n    <fieldset>\n\n        <input data-validation-group=\"group-1\" required  />\n\n        <input data-validation-group=\"group-1\" type=\"submit\" />\n    </fieldset>\n    <fieldset>\n\n        <input data-validation-group=\"group-2\" required  />\n\n        <input data-validation-group=\"group-2\" type=\"submit\" />\n    </fieldset>\n</form>\n\n<script>\n    $(function(){\n        $('body').on('click', function(e){\n            var validationGroup;\n            if(e.target.type == 'submit' && (validationGroup = e.target.getAttribute('data-validation-group'))){\n                var filter = '[data-validation-group=\"'+ validationGroup + '\"]:invalid';\n                var invalids = $('input' + filter +', select' + filter +', textarea' + filter);\n                if(invalids.length){\n                    invalids.trigger('updatevalidation');\n                    e.preventDefault();\n                    return false;\n                }\n            }\n        });\n    });\n</script>\n```\n\nIn case you have buttons, that are doing different things HTML5 has added the `form*` attributes (`formtarget`, `formaction`, `formnovalidate` and so on).\n\nSo you can do this without any scripting:\n\n``` html\n<form class=\"ws-validate\">\n    <fieldset>\n        <input required  />\n        <input formnovalidate=\"\" value=\"save\" type=\"submit\" />\n        <input value=\"submit\" type=\"submit\" />\n    </fieldset>\n</form>\n```\n\nBut your request is quite special and therefore you always need to extend it with some little JS. As shown above you can write it pretty general so that you will be able to re-use them in all your ASP.Net projects, but I can't add something, that is only a special case. It's nice that we have an API for this.\n\nAnd about the approach of ASP.NET. This is not busted due to HTML5, it already was against semantics in HTML3.2. \n\nFor example screenreader users can jump from form to form. Making it easy to jump to search form, login form and/or contact form. This feature is busted. \n\nAnother HTML4 feature is, that if you hit enter in a text-ish input the form get's submitted (by clicking the first submitter automatically). I don't know ASP webforms, but in case this might still work \"magically\", they had to re-implement this native feature by script, because the native feature is busted. At least at this point it should have become clear, that every feature that directly hooks into the semantics or extends the behavior of a form element is busted by this approach.\n\nIn general I like technologies, where you write some code and then your HTML/CSS/JS is scaffolded for you, but it has to be made the right way (with standards in mind). Extend it instead of break it!\n"

        "body": "Thanks a lot Alex.\nYour code inspired me.\nI have used your sample codes and create a patch to emulating Validation Group behaviors exactly like the original ASP.NET Web Forms mechanism.\n\n``` javascript\nvar invalidValidationGroupAttribute = '[data-validation-group=\"{0}\"]:invalid';\nvar invalidElementSelector = 'input{0},select{0},textarea{0}';\n\nvar getInvalidElementSelector = function (groupName) {\n    var attribute = invalidValidationGroupAttribute.replace(/\\{0\\}/gi, groupName);\n    return invalidElementSelector.replace(/\\{0\\}/gi, attribute);\n};\n\nvar invalidUngroupedSelector = (\n    'input:not(input{0}){1},' +\n    'select:not(select{0}){1},' +\n    'textarea:not(textarea{0}){1}')\n    .replace(/\\{0\\}/gi, '[data-validation-group]')\n    .replace(/\\{1\\}/gi, ':invalid');\n\nvar emulateValidationGroup = function (eventArgs) {\n    var target = eventArgs.target; // additional variable to help more minification\n    var type = target.type; // additional variable to help more minification\n\n    if (type && type.toLowerCase() == 'submit') {\n        var validationGroup = $(target).data('validationGroup');\n\n        var invalidElements;\n        if (validationGroup) {\n            var invalidSelector = getInvalidElementSelector(validationGroup);\n            invalidElements = $(invalidSelector);\n        } else {\n            invalidElements = $(invalidUngroupedSelector);\n        }\n\n        if (invalidElements.length) {\n            invalidElements.trigger('updatevalidation');\n\n            eventArgs.preventDefault();\n            return false;\n        }\n    }\n};\n\n// window.onload event handler predefined by ASP.NET AJAX Client Library\n// it is equivalent to jQuery(window).load(function (eventArgs) { ... });\nfunction pageLoad() {\n    $('form').attr('novalidate', 'novalidate'); // it can be hard-coded inside <form> begining tag\n\n    $('body')\n        .off('click', emulateValidationGroup) // because of ASP.NET AJAXify asynchronous post back\n        .on('click', emulateValidationGroup);\n}\n```\n\nI tested it on some my last apps. All of them work good. So thanks a lot.\n\nIn case of your descriptions, I am not expert to concepts of web standards like you, but I think your opinions about busted standards, rationally, is true. Also I think ASP.NET Web Forms is a great framework for building wide range of data-centric web apps since 2001 to now. And I think Microsoft is a great innovator company.\n\nIn case of hitting Enter as clicking of form's default button, I know there is 2 ways for it, by markup declaration and by C#/VB codes. and Yes, it is pre implemented by JS as a part of ASP.NET 2.0 render engine and works good.\n\nAnyway...\nWhen IE 10 had been released, because of supporting HTML5 Form Validation, I researched to find a way to use this great capability instead of Validator Components of ASP.NET Web Forms and to date, this was a nightmare to me. So, I'm extremely grateful for your considerations, solutions, and inspiring of me, and at the end for your lovely webshim.\nGood Luck Alex.\n"

Have I missed something obvious?\n\nAfter reading this issue, I did check to see that my X-UA-Compatibility meta tag was setting the IE rendering engine to edge, so that shouldn't be the problem.\n\nAnyway, I'm building my form interactively, so I start with an empty `<table>` and then as the user clicks a button, rows with form elements (`<input type=\"date\"...`) get added, but there is no shimmed UI in place on those.\n"

The Chrome version is the same (43.0.2357).\n\nThat's part of our config\n\n``` javascript\n$.webshims.setOptions(\"forms\", { \ncustomMessages: true, \nreplaceValidationUI: true, \naddValidators: true \n});\n```\n\nwe don't have this problem in any other browser.\n\n**Update**\n\nYou can take a look at this fiddle in Chrome 43: http://jsfiddle.net/39gzcfdc/ \n\nSteps:\n1. Do not enter any information in the fields\n2. Press the \"Submit\" button\n3. You should see a tiny tooltip on the bottom-left border of the fieldset with no text in it\n\nAnother way to reproduce:\n1. Fill in the fields name and email\n2. Leave the \"address\" field empty\n3. Press \"Submit\"\n4. You will be prompted to \"Please fill out this field\", which is expected\n5. Go back to \"email\" field and enter invalid email (e.g. `111111`)\n6. Press \"Submit\"\n7. You will be prompted to \"Please fill out this field\" again (it will at the bottom-left border of the fieldset)\n\nI hope that this helps.\n"

        "body": "Yeah, reason for this is that the fieldset element itself now also fires an invalid event, if there are invalid elements inside. Additionally also the `:invalid` selector also applies to `fieldset` elements. The same is also true for `form` elements.\n\nWhich is basically a great feature. For example you can do this:\n\n``` css\nform:invalid [type=\"submit\"] { cursor: not-allowed;}\n```\n\nBut I really don't understand, why the semantics of an existing event and an selector is extended, instead of inventing a new one.

That language seems to use the 24-hour clock. What I don't want to do, is switch all users to English - they may not be English. I am still curious to know where the 12-hour clock is coming from, because I feel I'm missing something there. If it's in that example you have given here, I'm just not seeing it.\n\nSo does `en-CUSTOM` extend the `en` locale, or completely replace it? There seems to be a lot of settings in your `en-CUSTOM` above that I would have thought were already defined in the underlying `en` language.\n\nThank you.\n"

Therefore as it doesn't extend `en` it will not have a meridian value (unless you put it there) and it will have a 24 hour time display. \n"

        "body": "I ran across this issue after a Rails app was upgraded last week to address CVEs in a set of standard Gems. The packaged JQuery must have been bumped, which led to this function being hidden from the published API.\n\nFor anybody needing a short term fix, I was able to regain the functionality by extracting the original JQuery code for .swap:\n\n```\n jQuery.swap = function( elem, options, callback, args ) {\n    var ret, name, old = {};\n    // Remember the old values, and insert the new ones\n    for ( name in options ) {\n            old[ name ] = elem.style[ name ];\n            elem.style[ name ] = options[ name ];\n    }\n\n    ret = callback.apply( elem, args || [] );\n\n    // Revert the old values\n    for ( name in options ) {\n            elem.style[ name ] = old[ name ];\n    }\n    return ret;\n};\n\n```\n\nNot a long term fix, but maybe useful for others who suddenly have broken Rails apps.\n"
