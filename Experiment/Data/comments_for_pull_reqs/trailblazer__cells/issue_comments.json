I'd move the routing behaviour to the controller, which could ask the cell to redirect or not. Just an idea.\n3. Another ugly, nasty approach would be to break encapsulation and instruct the parent_controller in the cell to redirect - wouldn't do that.\n4. When cells get interactive I usually switch to Apotomo widgets, so I don't have to care about all that. I just hit submit which triggers an apotomo event, catch that in my form widget and process it. This is a more RIA-like approach.\n\nLet me know if I can help you anywhere.\n\nCheers,\nNick\n"

So now controller decides about showing full site (on error) or redirecting (on success).\n\nSomething like this:\n\n```\ndef specialized_action\n  find_item\n  comment = params[:comment]\n  @comment = @item.comments.new\n  @comment.comment = comment[:comment]\n  @comment.user = current_user\n  if @comment.save\n    redirect_to item_path(@item, :anchor => \"comment-#{@comment.id}\") and return\n  end    \n  render \"items/show\"\nend\n```\n\nBut still it's clumsy. I'll try Apotomo and get back to you if it doesn't work ok for me somehow.\n"

Nevertheless, Cells are \"only\" view components, and hence they aren't supposed to do everything.\n\nYou could also try \n\n<pre>\nhelper_method :parent_controller\n</pre>\n\n\nto access parent_controller in your view. The same applies for your fix, just wrap it in a `def flash` and declare it as helper method.\n\nGood to hear you're still not too encouraged ;-)\n"

Are you using Passenger?\n\nBeside that, when I use `RAILS_RELATIVE_URL_ROOT` only the asset links get prepended the new root - both link_to in cells and in ordinary controller views still point to the old root.\n\nNick\n"

        "body": "Yeah, AC::UrlFor redefines #url_options and accesses `request`, which is kinda breaking the encapsulation Cells advocates. Don't get me wrong, I like your solution as it simply includes one single module. However, this module internally does things that scare me.\n\nIn Cells we really try hard to encapsulate things whereas the ActionController simply includes everything. This is nice for the end user but also adds evil dependencies to your classes.\n\nOne decision in Cells is _not_ being dependent on request/response per default. This change would tighten the coupling between HTTP and Cells. Maybe we should include your solution in the Troubleshooting wiki page?\n\nMy thought behind all this is: Cells are view components, and they really shouldn't know about hosts and HTTP. So, if you really want your cell to \"break\" this, you might include the module yourself, saying \"I really want my cell to access HTTP stuff\". Can you get my points?\n"

        "body": "Passing *_url helpers into a Cell as arguments is a very poor solution.  What if someone is trying to utilize a Cell(s) to build a dynamic navigation menu?  This is a perfect use case for a Cell.  They could be passing 6 or 7 url strings into the Cell along with other arguments.  That would shoot code readability in the foot.\n\nI would argue behind these types of methods being necessary precisely because Cells are view components.  A helper as basic as root_url is utilized in views all the time to link back to the home page.  Note that root_path is not always an option for some people (you must use _url if you have subdomains for example).\n\nThere is another option.  url_options, like I already said, is already being included from ActionDispatch::Routing::UrlFor.  Instead of including the AC reimplementation, Cells could override url_options, eliminating the lines of code that modify the request (there are only a couple, most request calls are accessors).  It is possible that we could get away with something as simple as this:\n\n```\ndef url_options(options)\n  @_url_options ||= super.reverse_merge(:host => request.host).freeze\nend\n```\n\nThis, however, is not only duplicating code, but I do not know the consequences of not including the parts of the method.  I'm willing to bet it would work in most scenarios, but eventually you are going to get someone that needs those other aspects of the request.\n"

It's because Sprockets' :after_initialize runs when config.assets.paths is not yet initialized and it just thinks that there are no assets. \n\nAnd it's not just rake task. The same goes if you run your Rails application - it should precompile the assets on the first access and this does not happen.\n"

That'd be fine, except jQuery's loaded at the bottom of the page, and the cell view is rendered in the middle of the page. So when the JS in the cell view executes, `$` is undefined.\n"

Now, injecting arbitrary content into some other \"block\" outside of the cell's scope violates encapsulation, since the cell has knowledge about the outer world (well, not really, but you get what I mean ;-) This is a new requirement which we have to meet.\n\nAnother idea could be that the cell has a second method to return JS, like the idea you had:\n\n``` ruby\nrender_cell(..) do |cell|\n  global_js_container << cell.javascript\n```\n\nI guess providing a `content_for` is less clumsy, although it breaks encapsulation.\n"

Check out this post to learn about passing options as explicit arguments to the state: http://nicksda.apotomo.de/2011/02/cells-3-5-release-party-summary/\n\n Does that help?

        "body": "Ok. So it seems that `Cell::TestCase` does not get automatically loaded by Test::Unit after all. That's because `lib/` directories from engines and railties are not added by Rails to `config.autoload_paths` automatically. I wonder why is it autoloaded by rspec-cells. Maybe it requires it explicitly?\n\nSo I think that CHANGELOG and README should be updated to say that when using `Test::Unit` you need to put `require 'cell/test_case'` in `test_helper.rb`. Or you could make cells add its `lib/` to `config.autoload_paths`. It would probably be something like this:\n\n``` ruby\n# lib/cells/railtie.rb\ninitializer 'cells.add_autoload_paths', :before => :set_autoload_paths do |app|\n  app.config.autoload_paths << File.expand_path(\"../../lib\", File.dirname(__FILE__))\nend\n```\n\nUPDATE: Since I made that change anyway to see if it works, here's a patch in case you wanted to use this: #72\n"

Also make it clear whether `options` is always equal to `args` or is it always a hash.\n\nAlso: is it possible to create a state that takes more than one argument (explicitly, by declaring two arguments, not as an array)?\n"

It therefore happily relies on setting instance state to operate, safe in the knowledge that no matter where it's called from, the state will be available.\n\nIn cells, because each render_cell call creates a new cell instance that the helper is mixed into, that state is lost.\n\nThere's no way around this that I can see. If you want sequential `render_cell` calls to have access to cycle information from the level above, the only solution is to pass it to them:\n\n```\n- 10.times do\n  = render_cell(:widget, :show, :item => @item, :cycle => cycle(\"odd\", \"even\"))\n```\n\nAnd actually, thinking about it, that's exactly how it should be. I'm using cells precisely because I don't want a monolithic heap of state to which everything has access. :-)\n\nI'll stop talking to myself now.\n"

        "body": "First of all, @apotonick , I want to say thank you for this magnific tool, it's just a little big revolution to my personal way of developing in Rails. I've just started a new project, using cells so I can find my way through it and plan the code structure from beginning.\n\nNow, lets get to @giates question.\n\nFirst of all, as I started using cells, I wanted to do everything the \"old school\" style: flash messages, global helpers, some logic in views... Then I realized that what I need is to do stuff different so it fits this new approach.\n\nAbout flash messages. In my project I use the Decorator patttern by using the draper(https://github.com/jcasimir/draper) gem. It helps to assign \"helper\" methods in a more OOP way. So I did with the flash messages, which now rely on a concrete class.\n\n# app/controllers/foos_controller.rb\n\n```\ndef create\n  @foo = Foo.new(params[:foo])\n\n  begin\n    @foo.save!\n    flash[:notice] = \"Created successfully!\"\n    redirect_to :controller => \"foos\", :action => \"index\"\n  rescue Mongoid::Errors::Validations\n    render :new\n  end\nend\n```\n- notice there is no flash[:error] used here, we'll come to it later!\n\n# app/cells/foo_cell.rb\n\n```\ndef flash_messages(foo)\n  @foo = FooDecorator.decorate(foo)\n  render\nend\n```\n\n# app/decorators/application_decorator.rb\n\n```\nclass ApplicationDecorator < Draper::Base\n\n  def errors\n    model && model.errors || {}\n  end\n\n  def notice\n    h.flash[:notice] if h.flash\n  end\n```\n- notice that I am using the `ActiveModel` \"errors\" method to show the errors.\n\nSo this way, I just render a cell above my pages so they can show the flash messages:\n\n```\n <%= render_cell :foo, :flash_messages, @foo %>\n```\n\nMaybe it is not the best approach, but it works for me very nicely. Actually, as I am writing this lines, I realize that an `application_cell.rb` would be a nice place to put the `flash_messages` cell so it can be reused in the whole application :)\n"

That's why I wrote [hooks](https://github.com/apotonick/hooks) years ago which implements the same as Callbacks but better. We have to write our own little filter layer using hooks in order to make state-args work in filters - I'm not willing to fix that in Rails itself as long as they're using the messy AS::Callbacks... sorry ;-)\n"

        "body": "So happy we finally address this issue. Here's the problem:\n\nIn order to make `Cell::Rails` feel like a real HTTPable ActionController we delegate some random methods to the parent_controller in the `Cell::Rails::Metal` module: https://github.com/apotonick/cells/blob/master/lib/cell/rails.rb#L10\n\nThis makes it necessary to provide the Rails cell a controller instance. Now, maybe this is not necessary in the routeable-cell setup. Maybe we don't need a controller instance there but a request object, only, which is available at the time we call `render_cell_for` (in `env`).\n\nSo, would you guys be ok with deriving your cells from, let's say, `Cell::Rack` and I will do the rest? \n"

        "body": "Honestly I'm not sure what's needed for what use cases. I think we can all agree that Cell::Rails represents an ActionController pretty well when normally rendering from a regular View. But if we're talking rendering from routes, it's missing needed rack pieces for things that rely on session and request. I'm not sure what a Cell would normally use from ActionController that would be missing when using Cell::Rack. I'm not a Rails expert, this is why I'm relying on a great gem like Cells to isolate widget MVC for clean organization. Currently I'm only interested in support for Devise and CanCan from a Cell that's been called from routes, as I know it'll work when rendering it from a normal View. I don't know what might not be available otherwise. Thanks.\n"

The above works, but it means the test double I pass to the `render_cell` call has to support every method used in the state's template, which I'm not so interested in testing at this level.\n\nFrom my point of view it'd be really nice to be able to test cell instances independently of the render pass (much like you can test Rails controllers without rendering templates). I think I can bodge around it for the moment by directly accessing `::Cell::Rails.create_cell_for`, but it feels a bit wrong.\n\nMay I ask why `TestCase#cell` was deprecated originally? I'd be happy to submit a pull request giving users some way to get hold of a cell instance without doing a render pass, but I don't want to trample all over design decisions you've made. :-)\n\nCheers,\nSimon\n"

        "body": "I popped the changes in and started looking at how to call it from routes.rb. The request in a ActionController seems to be an ActionDispatch::Request object. In routes.rb, I think you can create it from env like so:\n\nrequest = ActionDispatch::Request.new(env)\n\nThis is the way it's done in ActionController::Middleware::ActionMiddleware.call. Doing it this way will basically assign env. The rest of the class variables you see when debugging are available as methods when constructing your own. e.g. request.fullpath, etc... If this works out, you might want to change Rack to accept env, then construct DispatchRequest there to make routes.rb require one less line.\n\nThe problem I'm having now is using Cell::Rack properly. (be gentle) My route looks like this now:\n\n```\nmatch \"/dashboard/widget/:name\" => proc { |env|\n  cell_name = env[\"action_dispatch.request.path_parameters\"][:name]\n  request = ActionDispatch::Request.new(env)\n  [ 200, {}, [ render_cell(cell_name, :display, request) ]]\n}\n```\n\nAnd my Cell looks like this:\n\n```\nclass MemberLatestLoginCell < Cell::Rack\n  include Devise::Controllers::Helpers\n  helper_method :current_member\n\n  def display(opts = { })\n    ...\n  end\nend\n```\n\nBut I'm getting: NameError (uninitialized constant Cell::Rack)\n\nI've probably screwed up adding your changes to my project. I honestly don't know if there's a proper way to test a custom or development Gem source set. I simply found the location of rails.rb (basically C:<project location>\\ruby\\1.9.1\\gems\\cells-3.8.3\\lib\\cell) and added Rack to it. (the change was clear)\n\nLet me know if I'm doing something naive please.\n"

In my Cell:\n        class MemberLatestLoginCell < Cell::Rack\n\nIn routes.rb:\n        match \"/dashboard/widget/:name\" => proc { |env|\n          cell_name = env[\"action_dispatch.request.path_parameters\"][:name]\n          #[ 200, {}, [ render_cell(cell_name, :display) ]]\n          request = ActionDispatch::Request.new(env)\n          [ 200, {}, [ Cell::Rack.render_cell(cell_name, :display, request) ]]\n        }\n\nWhen requesting the Cell route I get: \n    ArgumentError (wrong number of arguments (0 for 1)):\n      config/routes.rb:46:in `block (3 levels) in <top (required)>'\n\nI did a gem uninstall cells, then with the Github linked Cells gem I bundled. It still notes the version as 3.8.3.\n\nThe error is occurring on Rack: \n\n```\nclass MemberLatestLoginCell < Cell::Rack\n```\n"

I'm stuck on Rails 2.3 and needed to upgrade cells from a plugin version I was using to the gem (3.3.9) to avoid deprecation warnings triggered by the plugin in Rails 2.3.6+.\n\nI used to do this:\n\n``` ruby\ndef my_cell\n    @variable = @opts[:variable]\n\n    render\n  end\n\nrender_cell :model_name, :my_cell, :variable => whatever\n```\n\nI get this error now:\n\n``` ruby\nThe error occurred while evaluating nil.[]\n\n/cells-3.3.9/lib/cells/cell/base.rb:340:in `render_view_for'\n/cells-3.3.9/lib/cells/cell/base.rb:281:in `render_view_for_backward_compat'\n/cells-3.3.9/lib/cells/cell/base.rb:269:in `render_state'\n```\n\nI'm confused as to why this functionality (passing in variables) seems to have been either removed or is buggy? Could you let me know how I'm supposed to access variables now? I presume access changed somewhere along the line. Alternatively, is there a gem version that doesn't trigger the deprecation warnings (`load_paths` and `returning`) but still allows the old functionality?\n"

I made a mistake subclassing the wrong class in my demo app.\n\nThe conclusion is that inheriting from Cell::Rails does not work.\n\nIf you download my demo app https://github.com/lulalala/demo_cell , and run `Note.new_mail.deliver` in the console, you can see the error about delegation.\n\n> ActionView::Template::Error: undefined method `request' for #<Note:0x007fcf2e2a6048>\n>   from ../cells-3.8.8/lib/cell/rails.rb:9:in`request'\n\nAt compile time, delegate method looks and see if parent controller has \"request\" method or not. Since it does not, an error was raised.\n\nSo I guess my original approach of subclassing from Cell::Base is the way to do it.\n\n**UPDATE**\n\nTrying to figure out how to do tests (sorry I only used Rspec before). I guess only two things needs to be tested:\n1. Cell does not raise delegation error when rendered.\n2. Cell renders full url for asset paths.\n\nSince both of them are related to config (one to set it up and one to use it), I think one integration test will do. Any thoughts?\n"

The problem is that this way requires changes to the Cells core, thus may not be desired.\n\nLet me know what you think about it ;)\n"

In the standard Rails stack, this is different: There's dozens of lines of code to make Devise work in tests. I personally find this wrong.\n\nI haven't looked at Devise in a long time, but it seems it is still designed very monolithic, relying on global variables like `current_user`, etc. You have to go the clumsy way here and use `helper_method` to import it into Cells.\n"

(e.g. ActionView extensions).\n2. The name `Cell` reflects the domain concern way better than `Cells`, I'd find it weird to have a `Cells::ViewModel` as I don't like plural class names in general when speaking about an entity.\n\nI agree that we could look over the Railtie location etc, but I definitely don't wanna merge the two. Do you find it confusing?\n\nBTW - I had some ideas this weekend for making a cell behave like an Apotomo widget, so stay tuned, I will need your help!\n"

I have tried to apply your commits since 3.9.1 into my code. But it's hard to understand something... Well code wasn't perfect year ago but now it's worse.\n\nBut we (you and I) have some different tastes here :smile: So I don't how I can help you here. But in my mind, the main: code has more... We say \u0432\u0435\u043b\u043e\u0441\u0438\u043f\u0435\u0434\u044b (bicycles) in Russia. Some own classes, overloaded methods of other libs when you can solve the problem via standard approach but maybe not so beatiful... Code is overcomplicated...\n"

In order to keep the code _clean_ the `Rails` cell needs to hook into several steps, otherwise we'd have to copy code (e.g. for builders).\n\nThen there's a couple of features (e.g. `Caching`) that is _not_ hardcoded in the core code but included as modules. Without knowing the core, it might be hard to follow, but that's a common principle accross all my gems and also used in many other projects.\n\nIn addition to that, there's helpers and stuff that doesn't fit into the `Cell` namespace, like ActionView extensions, the Railtie and all that stuff.\n\nWith Cells 4.0 it will get a lot easier as we don't have the fuckin' `parent_controller` bleeding through anymore. In other words, `Cell::Rack` and `Cell::Base` get redundant.\n\nGive me an example what you find dirty about the existing code!!!\n\n---PS: Another complication might be the `VersionStrategy`. Cells is compatible with Rails 3.0, 3.1, 3.2, 4.0 and 4.1 so far and that's something we should be proud of.\n"

        "body": "Hey,\n\n1) Absolutely no idea. Cells are just parts of your view and will be rendered with your page. So, that should work. I personally find turbolinks one of the worst ideas ever and wouldn't use it at all. If you want AJAX widgets, check out Apotomo, which works on top of Cells.\n\nThe Apotomo approach is a bit more work as you need to define widgets, but you get to control _what_ updates _when_. Give it a go, I love it!\n\n2) A very old one, sorry :) The Trailblazer example app will contain an in-depth example of Cells as a view model. This is completely unrelated to other Trailblazer concepts, so you will easily be able to extract the knowledge you need.\n\nAlso, the book will contain a huge section about Cells. I'm sorry I'm not providing more docs atm but it's impossible for me to maintain all those gems and provide example apps at the same time. Maybe you want to help?\n"

I had the same idea, but then realized that it's totally fine to use Cells and the concept file layout without any other Trb feature, so I decided it's ok to \"bundle\" it into the gem.\n\nSince Trb is a mash-up of Cells, Reform, etc., I was planning to put trb-specific _extensions_ to the latter into the `trailblazer` gem itself, instead of having one gem per layer. Also, I try to make the new features available to \"non-trb\" Rails projects, so \"conventional\" Rails users can take advantage of the concept file layout without having to install trailblazer, for instance.\n\nI don't know if that makes sense :) Do you see any issues with the concept cell generators being part of cells itself?\n"

Thanks to this, the `form_for` (and any other code that require a block) can rid off the `capture` dependencies and just use the result of the block. This should fix the issue.\nProbably we could remove the entire `with_output_buffer`.\nIn my opinion, this solution is a lot cleaner than use `with_output_buffer` and I can't really understand why they doesn't implemented it this way already.\nEven if it's true that a new buffer will be created for each block, I can't think at any method/helper that require a block _and_ doesn't use `capture`, hence at the end this should give a tiny boost in performance.\n\nHowever, this will work only in HAML and not in ERB or any other template builder...\nGems should not be a problem, because `capture` can also be rewrote to take advantage of the block's internal buffer (could be practically a yield).\n\nDo you think I should implement this? Should I contact someone of Rails to propose this modification?\n"

Namely, they use `with_output_block` to introduce a temporary buffer, expecting the block to use it, BUT cell's template manager will not use it, causing the problem that we already have.\n\nPlus, the solution of a custom template for only cells, isn't that good, because at the end the helper will call its `with_output_block`. The only two possibilities I can think about are: monkeypatch AV and the Builder (haml, erb, ...) so that `with_output_block` is practically a yield; replace AV with something else (and tweak the builders).\n"

However, the block itself is bound to the cell's context, not the helper's one, causing the temp buffer to remain empty and the block's result to be appended to the cell's one.\nThat's why the input tag is rendered before the form one, while the latter is empty.\n\nTechnically the buffer is not _global_, any instance of AV has it's own, but if I got this correctly, rails use the same AV instance for every template.\n\nAgain, this is a problem only if you want to use another instance of AV as a helpers container.\n"

Because the block context isn't the instance of `A`, but, in this case at least, the global context.  Hence, even if we change `@a` in the instance, this will not affected the block, that instead will consider the `@a` of the global context, as you can see in the second example.\nThat's exactly the cause because we cannot bypass the helper's buffer.\n\n``` ruby\nclass A\n  def m(&block)\n    @a = 1\n    instance_exec &block\n  end\nend\n```\n\nThis approach evaluate the block in the instance context, and example of before will always return `1`, BUT we cannot use this solution in this case because all the power of the cell itself will vanish:\n\n``` haml\n= helper.form_for(m) do |f|\n  = f.text_field :name\n  = override_me\n```\n\nIn this case `override_me` will be a method of ViewModel, see it as an entry point for extensions, but if we bound the block to the `helper` context, `override_me` will be also evaluated in that context and an error will raise.\n\nAgain, the solution isn't that difficult, but I think the only way is to directly modify `ActionView#with_output_buffer` _and_ every template manager therefore blocks will use an internal buffer, that will be the result of the block itself.\n\nReally, it's harder to explain than to implements, but require the collaboration both of Rails and all the people that manage gems like HAML, Erubis, etc... Quite the big thing for a small, yet useful change.\n"

I've searched into their site, and there's no mention to blocks.\n\nFor what I know, HAML supports block, but doesn't give them an internal buffer as I've done with Erubis (it's easier to achieve), hence has problem with helpers.\n\nBy the way, the code gives an internal buffer to each block, called by the name of the buffer + `_tmp`. This also works with nested blocks; at each level a new `_tmp` is appended and removed on exit.\n\n**UPDATE**\nI've just digging in HAML code, and as I thought they have a rails-like approach: instead of manage the problem at low level, they just implements a `capture_haml` method, that do what we already discussed in #211 \n"

I think it just has a problem with the way Rails uses capture, that's why they override it. I got it working now by [copying the capture code](https://github.com/apotonick/cells/commit/62d96c0938f751dd6d530195f3e83b9eae0d6ed6).\n\nThe only problem here is that the inner block is escaped because it's not a `SafeBuffer`.\n\nI totally do not understand why this is so messed up? Isn't it pretty simple? If a line starting with `=` is in the block, you capture that and then return it internally?\n\nWhat are we gonna do? Should we start talking to the Haml guys? They are awesome and really helpful. Maybe we can simplify this once and forever?\n"

        "body": "You could just use another name for your implementation. I will use your ERB, then. No need to try to make old stuff work.\n\nBTW, the way we find and render templates also changes: A cell now has _one_ template engine, e.g. `haml`. This is per class. If you need to render something else, you can do `render format: :erb`. Reason for this is because in 99.9% an encapsulated cell needs exactly one template engine. You don't use 2 or 3 different for one widget (I do, but that's another story ;).\n\nThen, the way we escape will be different to Rails. We don't escape anything per default. This is hundred times faster than going through _every_ string and escape it. I am thinking of escaping on the method level.\n\n``` haml\n.header\n  = author_name!\n  = id\n```\n\nNot sure if the bang'ed method name will return escaped, or the normal one. However, the concept is to escape the reader's value and not _everything_. If people don't use readers it's their problem.\n\nThis will greatly speedup as we don't do a regexp per string! :fireworks: \n"

As an example, we found lots of helpers that do escaping wrong. This wasn't visible in a vanilla Rails app but in an isolated environment it would break.\n\nThat's a good thing, so hopefully the Rails helpers will become cleaner. If you find problems, please ask me first, we can then communicate it to the Rails core team.\n"

        "body": "Ok, I think I have a bit of a handle on this now.  When you call \"image_tag\" in the standard AssetTagHelper it calls a method path_to_image which calls a method asset_path in AssetUrlHeper which calls a method compute_asset_path.  This method also in AssetUrlHelper is meant to be overridden and it is by sprockets-rails: https://github.com/rails/sprockets-rails/blob/master/lib/sprockets/rails/helper.rb#L65. This is the critical method.  If the result of calling asset_digest_path is nil (which it will be if the Sprockets ENV is not set in the included class) then super is called and the default '/images' path is used.  In order to set the Sprockets ENV in the included Cell I found you need to do the following:\n\n```\nclass NavbarCell < Cell::ViewModel\n include Sprockets::Rails::Helper\n\n  self.assets_prefix = Rails.application.config.assets.prefix\n  self.assets_environment = Rails.application.assets\n\n  def show\n    render\n  end\nend\n```\n\nMaybe there is a better way to do this.  I also don't know if there are other Sprocket Settings that need to be copied in lest there be unintended side effects.. Will probably just see how it goes for now. \n"

We want to use it as an alternative for the patched mess from Rails in Trailblazer.\n\nAlso, we want **clean** ERB support in Cells as I met quite a few cells users who prefer ERB over HAML.\n\nAn additional benefit is that we can push all our fixes and clean-ups into your gem. If the original ERB decides to get up-to-date we can always merge back. But I guess it might end similar to HAML and Slim.\n\nPlease, go for it!\n"

I had to dig into repository to find out the latest stable version  3.3. \n"

Let's say for the cart I have \"show\" (which displays all items in cart) and I have \"info\" (which shows only a summary (e.g. count) of all items in cart).\nThese would have been two actions which call the render command. \n\nIs it correct to have different actions in the model view concept aswell or should I use the options hash. \nSo would I do it like \n\n``` ruby\ncell(:cart, user).call(:show)\n# and\ncell(:cart, user).call(:info)\n```\n\n<b> or </b>\n\n``` ruby\ncell(:cart, user, mode: 'full').call(:show)\n# and\ncell(:cart, user, mode: 'summary').call(:show)\n```\n\nCertainly I don't want to create a new cell, because they might share alot of instance methods.\n"

Cells has been extremely stable since 3.x so I'm not sure when was the last time you checked it out...?\n\nI thought the documentation clearly says the README is for 4.0. Maybe add a line saying \"not yet released\" or something? Would that help?\n\nYou wouldn't believe how much work it is to fix all the crap that Rails has messed up in the last years. Cells 4.0 comes without ActionView and we need to fix/remove a lot of things in template engines like HAML, where HAML monkey-patches Rails helpers to make them work due to bugs in Rails, and so on. It is incredible and we do our best to ship an awesome 4.0.\n\nA lot of people use the master branch in production already (me too), so give it a go!\n"

        "body": "Hey David, thanks for that valid comment. The thing is, I completely change the semantic of a cell. In Cells 4 we get away from Rails and its controller-orientation to an actual _view model_.\n\nHere's the difference.\n\n``` ruby\nrender_cell(:song, :show, @song)\n```\n\nresults in \n\n``` ruby\nclass SongCell < Cell::Rails\n  def show(song)\n```\n\nThe song argument is passed into `#show` in the old dialect.\n\nNow, Cells 4.\n\n``` ruby\ncell(:song, @song).(:show)\n```\n\nIn Cells 4, the `cell` helper instantiates a cell with all the arguments, then calls the view state*.\n\n``` ruby\nclass SongCell < Cell::ViewModel\n  def initialize(song)\n\n  def show\n```\n\nAs you can see, you'd have to change your view states anyway (unless you patch).\n\nYou can surely introduce your own `#render_cell` helper that does exactly this behind the scenes (you can still do `cell(:song).show(@song)` but I have to warn you: The way helpers work has changed, some ActionView hacks are not gonna work in Cells 4, and many other things, such as a changed `#render` API.\n\nCells 4 is not meant to be a drop-in replacement for your cells 3 components - you have to migrate them manually in some cases. I can totally understand your concern and we will make this as painless as possible, but in order to smash this milestone we have to be aggressively changing, otherwise we will end up like other major \"MVC\" frameworks and keep treading water. :wink: \n\n*BTW, the call styles are documented in [my book](https://leanpub.com/trailblazer) in chapter 6 - I am gonna publish this chapter this week.\n"

So I notice that Gemfile.lock is missing rails, so I add `gem \"rails\"` to Gemfile and try again, and...same error.\n\nHOWEVER. Trying it all again just now, I notice that Gemfile.lock now has a dependency on rails 0.9.5 (wha?), so I change Gemfile to say `gem \"rails\", \"4.2.0\"`, and rebundle, and now...\n\nHey. It works. :P So, maybe I'm doing it wrong, but it seems like your Gemfile might need a dependency on rails itself, and not just actionpack? (Maybe this is the fault of rails 4.2.0?)\n"

Digging into the cells code shows that it's this method in ViewModel:\n\n```\ndef output_buffer\n  @output_buffer ||= []\nend\nattr_writer :output_buffer # TODO: test that, this breaks in MM.\n```\n\nThis can be fixed by monkey patching like this, but it is bringing back ActionView:\n\n```\nmodule Cell\n  class ViewModel < AbstractController::Base\n\n  private\n    def output_buffer\n      @output_buffer ||= ActionView::OutputBuffer.new\n    end\n  end\nend\n```\n\nThe longer term fix would be defining output_buffer to something that supports all the methods ActionView requires.\n"

Helpers automatically assume that all the other helpers are magically there.\n\nThis is not my fault, but a Rails design flaw. I am hoping that Cells 4 will gently force Rails core and other helper authors to properly include dependent modules into their helpers.

If your engine bundles cells that should simply be usable across the app, you could simply reset the `view_paths` and it would still work with the current (insufficient) implementation\n   \n   ``` ruby\n   MyEngine::Cell.view_paths = \"/var/engines/app/cells/\"\n   ```\n2. The problem arises when you _inherit_ from engine cells  in another directory (do you guys do that?).\n   \n   ``` ruby\n   class SongCell < MyEngine::Cell\n   ```\n   \n   Now that application cell needs two bases, namely `Rails.root/app` (application) and `/var/engines/...`.\n\nI'm wondering if we should merge prefixes and view_paths. There's simply no such case where you'd want Cells to look for `/var/engines/cells/song/show.haml` (application cell in engine, it's never gonna be there). Likewise, you don't want it to search for `Rails.root/app/cells/myengine/show.haml` because overriding engine views in the application namespace without actually inheriting from the engine is super dirty.\n\nThoughts?\n"

When inheriting, we simply inherit `::prefixes` from the parent cell, the way we do it now.\n   \n   ``` ruby\n   HitCell < MyEngine::Cell\n   HitCell.prefixes #=> [\"app/cells/hit\", \"/var/my_engine/cells/my_engine\"]\n   ```\n4. If you're not happy with that, you can push more onto `::prefixes`\n   \n   ``` ruby\n   class MegaHitCell < Cell::ViewModel\n     def self.prefixes\n       super + SongCell.prefixes\n     end\n   end\n   \n   MegaHitCell.prefixes #=> [\"app/cells/hit\", \"app/cells/song\"]\n   ```\n\nThis greatly reduces the lookup algorithm complexity and makes it simply to understand where views come from, no need to explain \"it first looks through base paths, then the prefixes, then the other base path, ...\" and so on.

If you find it out, I'll fix it.\n\nWent through your repository - looks great! First I thought you were already using Trailblazer due to the `app/concepts` directory, but .. not _yet_!\n\nA lot of things have happened in Cells 4 - can you upgrade to the release candidate and see if your tests still pass? Thanks! :heart: \n"

If you change the signature of a function in Haskell, you have to change your user code, too, don't you? Disabuse me as I haven't programmed Haskell in a long time. :hourglass_flowing_sand: \n\n@barttenbrinke Sorry to increase your workload. I had to change the public semantics - we needed to get rid of this \"Rails crust\" to keep innovating. The result is a super-lean core library now, some users reported rendering speed-ups of factor 2-3. :rocket: \n\n`#call` hasn't been removed - what makes you think so? Do you have specs for all your cells? If not, this is a good chance to write quick smoke tests, with Cells 4 it's even simpler now without all those hacks to make AV behave the way we want it in tests.\n\nI will try to add another section to the upgrade guide to address your trouble, @barttenbrinke.

        "body": "@apotonick not saying it'll eliminate API changes but IMO the Haskell community is less prone to make changes without a lot of consideration toward legacy code bases. For example if you pick up the Real World Haskell book from 2010 it still applies to most of the current ghc version. If you try the same with a ruby book your results will vary. IMO Functional Programming requires a lot less upkeep over time. I'm not against a server that can compile to a single bin (snap) and can handle requests in the 60k+ range vs rails 2-6k range. Plus concurrency. \n\nI see this upkeep issue as a massive problem/viewpoint in the ruby/rails community, eg. rails 2 -> 3 was a massive undertaking and some companies just couldn't manage it. rspec 2 -> 3 was a pretty major API change about half of my code is still stuck on rspec 2. rails 4.0 -> 4.1 -> 4.2  pretty much within a year of each other with some serious minor API changes that deprecate current functionality but add very little IMO improvement wise. \n\nSo the end result is a developer spends a majority of time just jumping their code through API changes vs. adding features to their applications. It becomes quite frustrating. Now we have a major release (5.0) about to break and its going to require more halt your development and update your code bases or be left behind security wise. \n\nAnother example is ruby 2.0.0 -> 2.1 -> 2.2. ruby 2.0 is pretty stable and there is a [known memory leak](http://samsaffron.com/archive/2015/03/31/debugging-memory-leaks-in-ruby) in 2.1 which allegedly was fixed in 2.2 but not in 2.1?!? However I still can't get puma to not bloat memory in 2.2 and have to run it in 2.0. Yet ruby 2.0.0 is in security maintenance phase and heading towards end of life while 2.1 and 2.2 are still kind of iffy IMO and probably deserve a Beta tag. Also things like refinements. What the hell is that all about? The community wasn't clamoring for that feature and most outright refuse to use it.  \n\nGenerally I think in our community we too easily leave old code bases behind from a security standpoint and justify it with \"its better\". Again these are probably more the ramblings of a burnt out developer who has had to maintain some nasty legacy codebases but I'd like us to have fewer API changes and work on some of ruby/rails core issues, i.e. more changes like ActiveModel/ActiveRecord separation or why was rails 2 faster performance wise than rails 3, etc.\n\nAnyway I shouldn't rant anymore here as this isn't the forum. LOL \n\nThanks @apotonick and team for all the work you do on this gem. I think its a great gem and helps me make my Rails app move toward more of a  \"functional\" paradigm. :+1: \n"

        "body": "Haha, this totally is a forum and you don't rant but bring up valid points.\n\nPlease don't use Rails as an example for change. Rails hasn't changed at all in the last decade, it's still stuck in it's primitive \"MVC\" thinking where other communities have moved on a long time ago. Rails problems actually _is_ the obsession to be backward-compatible. This is why (what you call) \"API change\" in Rails means that AR scopes suddenly have a different naming scheme or callbacks can be stopped by emiting a special symbol.\n\nThis is not change, this is a cosmetic improvement. Still inconvenient, as you say, but superficial and absolutely not fixing the actual problems Rails has on an architectural level.\n\nAnyway, to come back to what you say. I don't think it's wrong to innovate. Innovation in programming means new structures, new objects (or functions) and new flows. And this means work for upgraders. :grin: I can't find this in Rails, though, whether this is a good or bad thing, I won't say in public haha.\n\nThink about these changes as this: I aggressively change my gems in order to make your life better. I do not simply decide that this method signature sucks or that class is useless, I collect input over the years and play with ideas permanently.\n\nAt some point, you simply figure out your original idea was suboptimal or misleaded (e.g. by trying to be \"Rails-like\"). And then you have to hardcore-change. I myself had to change about 20 cells in our current production project, it didn't really hurt and in the end I could see a significant performance increase, zero hacking in tests anymore, and the good feeling of having decoupled my code from Rails.\n"

I think perhaps I'm misspeaking when I say API changes too. Really I mean OCD changes made in the spirit of the new and not always thought out shiny. Too often I see changes such as changing a method name arbitrarily or refactorings that seem to only be for the purpose of satisfying a developers' fancy or implement some new feature that hasn't really been proven, e.g. refinements in ruby. But our community does this a lot and justifies breaking changes with SemVer. \n\nIf more developers took your approach the community would be better off.  My main issue is that ruby is so dynamic and can so easily have side effects that to make changes without thought/consideration is a dangerous trend. If we had type safety it might be different, but that's never going to happen in ruby. Although gems like Contracts gives me some hope there can be intermediate solutions for ruby. \n\nAnyway as I said I have no problem with the changes you made here. I think the benefits outweigh the entropy cost plus you are moving in a super sane direction by distancing yourself from ActiveRecord and toward SRP type of design in cells. :+1: \n"

Honestly, a web framework that uses super low-level _language_ tools, that's just not good. Another thing was when everyone dropped 1.8 support to have 1.9 hash syntax... WTF?\n\nI would _love_ to see typing in Ruby, and different method signatures depending on the argument types, as we have it in Java. Thanks for your kind words! :heart: \n"

In cells, this method is only called once per view, so this creates a new output buffer and thus forgets some input (as we're appending to two different output buffers).\n\nIf you want to learn how it's done right, check out how slim does it. No need to fix anything there, as it's really clean. I will soon change Erbse to support these operations on the ERB level.\n\nIn case you're interested in all this and want to help - just let me know, I can give you an introduction and then maybe you want to play with Erbse a bit? :cake: \n"

When I uploaded that code without change to staging, it started escaping HTML entities (no html_safe).\n\nMaybe, in staging & production module `Cell::RailsExtensions::ViewModel` doesn't get mixed in for some reason? I deploy code via Capistrano and restart server with each deploy, trying `puma restart` and `puma start/puma stop`.

I tried the above inside the class and outside, neither worked. Perhaps a class method for Cell::ViewModel that would override initialized setting would be useful, similar to Rails' table_name settings on models. \n"

        "body": "That sounds like two unrelated issues, @nacengineer. This ticket was about \"activating\" the template engine for a cell before 4.0 was released.\n\nYou want to use two engines in one project. The problem here is that each gem (cells-haml, etc.) will try to include itself into `Cell::ViewModel`, so the last one wins.\n\nWe can't simply provide multiple engines with an option in `#render`, as every template engine needs different helpers to be patched (again, this is not my fault) which implies the cell to include those helpers.\n\nThe only real solution is to suppress Cells-in-Rails-mode to automatically include those engines and let the user do it, but then people will complain that this is \"not convenient\". See the problem? What do you think?\n"

We could simply catch the block and evaluate it in cells context.\n\nMany people use `content_tag` blocks in cell methods to achieve just that.\n\nI had a slightly different idea a few years ago and I was evaluating either Erector or Ambre where you have the templates defined in Ruby, in the cell itself instead of a rather clumsy template snippet. This does not only speed up things but also allows way better overriding semantics, where you can programmatically overwrite parts of your \"view\" in subclasses.\n\n``` ruby\nclass SongCell < Cell::ViewModel\n  view do\n    div do\n      address1\n      address2\n    end\n  end\n```\n\nI remember I loved the Erector gem by @alexch but we never integrated the two projects. Maybe it's time now? :fireworks: \n"

This is why `form_for` works, but to make formtastic run, you need to include the required helpers manually. Here's an example: https://github.com/apotonick/cells/blob/master/test/rails4.2/app/cells/formtastic_cell.rb\n\nIf you want to learn more, read the _Cells_ chapter of the Trailblazer book where I speak about this, too.\n\nBTW: Passing objects around in Ruby is never costly, so what you do is clumsy, but should be equally fast. However, in Cells 4, we want to completely stop using ActionView so please don't do it.\n"

        "body": "Hi!\n\nThe truth is that I'm using Cells in a way that I'm afraid you're not going to like at all. Instead of passing the object or collection to the cell as an argument, I'm retrieving them inside of the cell ifself. I saw in the examples that I should do it the other way round, but I prefer to have this part isolated in the cell rather than having it in all the controllers implicated.\n\nThe problem comes when, following this logic, I need to use CanCan inside the cell. Its \"load_and_authorize_resource\" method, expecting to be in a controller (where this function is available),  calls internally \"before_filter\" in order to verify if you have permission to see the resource of not.\nI presume that this precise case could be resolved by delegating the method execution to the controller, but I wasn't able to make it work when I tried.\n\nAnyway, with CanCan or not, retrieving model data inside the cell is what's causing the need of using filters in certain cases. Since I'm using Cells in a way different than they were meant to, maybe I should use another gem or whatever. If you have any thoughts, I'm all ears. :relieved:\n"

        "body": "Thanks for the chat @apotonick .\n\nIt seems that the Readme is no longer true for cells 4.0.2. Although I did not need to render a Global partial in the end, I still experimented with this on my way and found a) `include Partial` raises an error and should be require 'cells/partial', but then from there I could not render a global partial anyway.\n\nThe solution for me to render a partial defined in my cells/location_variable folder was as you suggested `= render view: '_translation_nested_form', locals:{ f: trans_form, disable: false }`\n\nso shall I investigate and be sure that the README rendering partials is incorrect, and then add a pull request for the readme?\n\nAlso is it an error with the view_paths as suggested above? i.e. no matter what view path is put in, the name of the cell is always added at the end of the path. Or is this intended?\n\nAnd do you think it would be helpful for me to add something to the readme about rendering partials in general, in the \"please do not read section\"?\n\nOne more thing, The biggest issue I faced was making use of Cocoon's link_to_add_association method which asks for the name of a partial. With @apotonick's encouragement I managed to do a monkey patch for Cocoon so that it uses the correct render call. Here is my monkey patch for anyone else in this situation:\n\nfrom within the cell, when you call link_to_add_association, pass in a render option `cells_compatible:true` like this:\n\n```\nlink_to_add_association \"add\", @form, :association_name,\n                          :partial => \"_partial_name\", render_options:{cells_compatible:true}\n```\n\n(note the leading underscore required in the partial_name)\n\nin some model, or however you like to do monkey patches, (I use a class_extensions.rb file in my models directory) add this code:\n\n```\nrequire 'cocoon/view_helpers'\n# overwrite the cocoon method which renders the partial for adding associations in the link_to_add_association helper method\nmodule Cocoon\n  module ViewHelpers\n    def render_association(association, f, new_object, form_name, render_options={}, custom_partial=nil)\n      partial = get_partial_path(custom_partial, association)\n      locals =  render_options.delete(:locals) || {}\n      cells_compatible = render_options.delete(:cells_compatible)\n      method_name = f.respond_to?(:semantic_fields_for) ? :semantic_fields_for : (f.respond_to?(:simple_fields_for) ? :simple_fields_for : :fields_for)\n      f.send(method_name, association, new_object, {:child_index => \"new_#{association}\"}.merge(render_options)) do |builder|\n        partial_options = {form_name.to_sym => builder, :dynamic => true}.merge(locals)\n        if cells_compatible\n          render view: partial, locals: partial_options\n        else\n          render(partial, partial_options)\n        end\n      end\n    end\n  end\nend\n```\n\nThis simply overwrites the same method in Coccon which looks like this\n\n```\ndef render_association(association, f, new_object, form_name, render_options={}, custom_partial=nil)\n  partial = get_partial_path(custom_partial, association)\n  locals =  render_options.delete(:locals) || {}\n  method_name = f.respond_to?(:semantic_fields_for) ? :semantic_fields_for : (f.respond_to?(:simple_fields_for) ? :simple_fields_for : :fields_for)\n  f.send(method_name, association, new_object, {:child_index => \"new_#{association}\"}.merge(render_options)) do |builder|\n    partial_options = {form_name.to_sym => builder, :dynamic => true}.merge(locals)\n    render(partial, partial_options)\n  end\nend\n```\n\nI will raise an issue with Cocoon now to see if they think it is worth me making a pull request.\n"

The actual paths to the cell's views is available via `ViewModel#prefixes`, you need to override that to point to another directory (but do _you_ really need this?).\n\n`render partial: ..`'s documentation is reflecting the actual behavior, see here: https://github.com/apotonick/cells/blob/master/test/partial_test.rb#L12 The difference is that your partial is _not_ in a global directory.\n\nI am probably gonna move the partial code to a separate gem soon (`cells-partial` or something), just to further discriminate this. I find it wrong to render partials from other stacks in a cell and want to ban this explicitly, otherwise people will keep hacking stuff instead of fixing the actual gem. Also, I then don't have to support this madness anymore. :wink: \n\nThe cleanest solution would be to \"fix\" `#render` in your cell, so when subsequent calls to `render` from cocoon are detected, change their API to ours.

It would mean my overwriting render method in my cell would have to be able to accept both combinations of paramaters, i.e\n\nfrom Cells::ViewModel the render method params = `def render(options={})`\nfrom ActionView::Helpers::RenderingHelper `def render(options = {}, locals = {}, &block)`\n\nI'll give it a whirl, Ta\n"

        "body": "Ok, here is my 'cleaner' solution as suggested by @apotonick(though not condoned :) ) . Brace yourselves, it may be cringeworthy, but for me it works pretty well so far and has helped me to understand better the issue that @apotonick has been trying to teach me.. i.e. there are problems when a gem makes use of a global rails helper such as `render`. I wonder what the alternative is then for such gems, should they explicitly include the helpers they need rather than rely on them being in the global set of helpers? I think I need to read that Trailblazer book.\n\nAnyway here is the code I added to my Cell, I'll probably extract it into a module and include it when I need to use it in other cells:\n\n```\n# Need to overwrite the cells render so that we can use Cocoon in the edit_letter_translations view\n# Cocoon assumes it is using ActionView::Helpers::RenderingHelper render method which accepts these parameters: def render(options = {}, locals = {}, &block)\n# but when rendered in the context of a cell, it hits the Cells::ViewModel render method which accepts different params = def render(options={})\n# so accept all params and massage these before sending them onto the Cells::ViewModel render with 'super'\ndef render(options = nil, locals = nil, &block)\n  #CASE 1 Cell calls render without arguments\n  if options.nil?\n    super(state_for_implicit_render(caller))\n\n  #Case 2 Cell calls render with either the name of a view or a single optios Hash as its paramater\n  elsif options.present? && locals.nil?\n    super options\n\n  #Case 3 render is called by Cocoon, intended for ActionView::Helpers::RenderingHelper so massage params such that Cells render can handle it\n  elsif options.is_a?(String) && locals.is_a?(Hash)\n    if block_given?\n      raise \"sorry don't know how to handle block in this custom override - ryan - see app/cells/location_variable_cell.rb:32\"\n    end\n    super({view: options, locals: locals})\n  else\n    raise \"Woops, this overriding render method written so that we could make use of Cocoon in Cells did not handle a render call properly, please see app/cells/location_variable_cell.rb\"\n  end\nend\n```\n\nThis covers all the cases I need to use render for, but I won't be surprised if we hit the \"Woops\" error one day.\n"

I guess it's to prevent collisions, but it makes translation files feel very clunky, and makes it hard to remember exactly where a key lives. Particularly for using facing keys, I generally end up avoiding the shortcut version anyways, and explicitly defining the key so I can have complete control\n\nIt also makes migrating to and from different frameworks a little obnoxious if you're using a non yaml backend file like the ActiveRecord backend, because now you have to write a migration that take all the keys that live under \"formtastic\" and move them to whatever. \n"

Aren't you all about strong, non-blurry APIs? :stuck_out_tongue_winking_eye: The API you suggest is indeed very \"railsy\".\n\nAlso, we want to drive things more towards using twins or structs instead of model/hash mixes, where the twin represents your actual domain object (even if that is a view domain-specific thing). This means, the cell will always get one \"model\" only and you don't use `@options` anymore.\n\nBTW, I am all-in for incorporating twins/decorators into the language itself. There's no reason we're still messing around with primitive hashes to simulate domain objects. Ruby could support that out-of-the-box and people would think different about what objects they pass around between layers.\n"

Also `concept` already has the newer, less magical API so making it even less magical by allowing the actual class constant seemed much more fitting for `concept` than `cell`. Further to that `cell`'s magical API of adding the `\"_cell\"` suffix would mean that `cell \"foo/bar\"`would have to become `cell Foo::BarCell` which is internally inconsistent for `cell`'s own API.\n"

I am just beginning to work with _Cells_ and my experience with _Trailblazer_ is not much greater.  My comment referred to the fact that I had not encountered this situation before and I was surprised by it.  On the other hand, this situation did forcibly impress on me one aspect of _Bundler_'s behaviour that I had not given much thought to.\n\nHowever, on further reflection, I think that the _principle of least surprise_ should apply here and that gems should in general `require()` their dependencies; unless there is a very good technical reason not to.  I do not know what common practice is but I tend to only explicitly list the minimum number of _Gems_ in my `Gemfile` and allow the dependency tree to bring in everything else.  This assists me in trimming back obsolete `gem` references to the bare minimum.  Which, over time, have proven an amazingly large number in several projects.\n\nAnyway, regardless of what you decide to do, thank you for your patience and help.  I am now into yet another `Cells` set-up issue which will no-doubt be resolved by re-reading the documentation or further begging for help in various venues.\n\nBy the way, forgive me if I appear dense, but is it your remark meant to imply that I should do as you suggest and submit the changes as a pull request?  I have no objection to doing so.  I just want to make the situation clear to myself and assume nothing.\n"

You brake the core principal of Cells by exposing all helpers to the Cell.\n\nI'm not so sure that it's that clear cut -- this issue had haunted this gem ever since I can remember.\n\nI understand that Cells is built with proper encapsulation in mind. Helpers are, on the other hand, global request cross-cutting concerns & functions that extend the existing template framework. What happens now is that an enormous part of standard Rails is completely unavailable (polymorphic routes across engines). This, naturally, leads to more hacks, not clean code, which is a shame since Cells provide a lot of power except for when you work with links across an extensible (by engine plugins) web application.\n\n> Even in a Rails related Cell, the Cell should have only the needed helpers.\n\nHow do you propose to predict this case for the user without blocking them? As I have seen over the last few years, that issue has yet to have an adequate solution, meanwhile, the standard Rails request context is simply unavailable to the Cell without hacks. I maintain that helpers solve the problem of extending the capacity of the _Base_ template itself, since some application extensions do belong to the global request context.\n\nUltimately users will abuse any tool, and helpers are almost always used inappropriately. Even Cells aren't immune. But there are cases when they are the proper solution. Internalisation, formatting, & tags are prime examples of extensions that belong to all cells if the underlying framework is already making this assumption. The same goes for the current user, the permission system, and if the application makes heavy use of it, the current category (as an extreme example of specific use case). Currently Cells only allow for a push model. This will enable both push and pull content models, a principle that works well for plugin systems.\n\n>  Every Rails related code will be removed from cells and will be go into cells-rails.\n\nThat's fair. Decoupling is the name of the game. Anything rails specific can be part of its include and override the original methods instead of updating them directly.\n"

I wanted to mention that I ended up going in a different direction, and started working on a different variation on the \"View Component\" theme using the MVP pattern instead of MVC. I assure you that I am not attempting to repeat [the architectures you've described](http://nicksda.apotomo.de/2010/11/rails-misapprehensions-what-the-fuck-is-mvp/). I don't know if that matters, but maybe you may find this approach more palatable -- its main distinction from MVC is that the entry point into these objects is the view, not the controller (which now controls only the view's presentation state and is called \"presenter\").\n\nI hope that given similarities some ideas can be exchanged. I certainly want to see a proper HMVC implementation alive and well and may tackle that as well on my own. The two patterns can work side by side.\n\nRepo is here: https://github.com/hazah/activeview\n\nThe dummy application is a small proof of concept.\n"

        "body": "@apotonick, yes I understand that this is a rather nuanced distinction. I will attempt to explain that this is a little more than just naming.\n\nBoth patterns have essentially the same division in responsibility, this is why it's hard to tell them apart. In essence, the main difference is the _point of entry_ & and their _modes of operation_.\n\nLets take our beloved MVC: We start at the controller and we call an _action_. This controller has the potential to have _many_ actions, each of which has the potential to direct you to one of _several_ views. So, MVC is a pattern where we have _one_ controller mapping its actions to _many_ views.\n\nNow for MVP: We start at the view and we give it _commands_. The view itself only records the parameters of the command and triggers _any number of actions_ on the presenter (what used to be the controller), which are responsible for getting the view ready for rendering. So, MVP is a pattern where we have _one_ view mapping its commands to _many_ actions.\n\nThe model layer is basically unchanged, except that since now you start from the view, the view objects themselves have an external interface that of a model (properties, callbacks, etc) -- so they can be called \"view models\" in the sense that they are modelling a view (the rendered data) through their properties. This also makes them something of a decorator, which leads to the \"Presenter\" pattern you normally hear about in Rails land where you just wrap a model and give it helper super powers.\n\n>  I'm struggling to see the difference to Cells?\n\nI think this is because Cells actually implements elements of _both_ patterns at the same time, but without any separation of each case. For instance, the Cell itself is essentially a view object, but its API would have you believe that its actually a controller. The most common case for Cells seems to be a single action controller. When that is the case, the stack resembles the MVP approach, except for the fact that you don't have a clean command interface to the resulting Cell other than \"render\". So you're stuck implementing them as a procedure in your action (state as you call them) -- this action is performing the role of a presenter, setting the Cell up for rendering. But when you implement several actions in your Cell, it ceases to look like a view object, but is now a gateway to _selecting_ one, and the Cell resembles a controller object.\n\n> The naming (to me) is completely irrelevant\n\nI'm very much the same. I hope to have illustrated the actual distinction apart from the name (which is actually more of a convenience than anything else -- presenters _are_ controllers, they are simply put to a slightly different task, which is to respond to commands on the view).\n\n> I don't even know what the official meaning for view model is haha.\n\nIt was invented by microsoft, so i wouldn't beat myself up over it ;). The technical distinction is that you have a view, a model, a view model (which is like a presenter but you execute commands on it directly instead of having the view forward them), and a binder that binds data properties from model to view for rendering and commands from view to view model for processing. \n\n> Is it only the wording in Cells that made you create this?\n\nNo, I've had this itch for years now. I have a very specific need of the implementation, and unfortunately nothing out there does it yet.\n"

Now, I'm able to do smth like:\n\n```\nrender view: :main do\n  render(view: :content) + render(view: :sidebar)\nend\n```\n\nor even\n\n```\nrender view: :main do\n  render(view: :content) + concept('smth/sidebar/cell').to_s\nend\n```\n\n![example](http://i.imgur.com/js6NxMN.png)\n\nIt works for Slim and to make it working with ERB and HAML, probably more changes are needed. Essentially I've removed buffer from `template_options_for` and passed a block [here](https://github.com/apotonick/cells/blob/master/lib/cell/view_model.rb#L103). If working with pure Tilt, it plays really smoothly.\n"

        "body": "Hi guys!\n\nThe approach I've shown above evaluated, a bit :smile:  . Because I am able to work with blocks, it lets me to do smth like:\n\n```\n    render view: :form, layout: :main do |f|\n      render view: :show, locals: {f: f}\n    end\n```\n\nwhich essentially not only covers the \"parent  child\" case, but also allows me to inject additional dependencies into child so I am able to create interactions among my components. You guys for sure ever created a GUI program which have had a graphic layout \u2013 perhaps I'm too old, because I'm using such dinosaur\u2013like example :smile: . Today I'd recall React probably... Anyway, in any language or GUI library it works the same, I mean you're able to create interactions among components in a way however you like. So any event happened in compontent X, may interact with component Y or Z in any manner.\n\nI am not sure, but perhaps we would be able to do that with @apotonick suggesstion,  e.g. create a `def form @form ||= Formular::Builder.new(...) ; end` , method so each view template is able to access the `form` . I think the same is affordable with @timoschilling use case, where I'd inject `self` as a concept model (and actually I'm doing it right now in many cases) so the \"child\" cell is able to access parent.\n\nHowever, I'm still kind of a fan of the \n\n```\nrender :smth do\n  render :blah + concept('cool/cell')\nend\n```\n\napproach, because I think it is simply easier to understand \u2013 at least for me. I mean, you see what goes where. Perhaps it works so nice for me, because I'm on Slim and Formular, so not touching any AcionView core (OK, except `content_tag`) or these are unrelated? \n\nWhat do you guys think about it? Right now I'm out of spare resources to investigate the remaining templates (ERB, HAML) and AcionView compontents (e.g `form_for`), but perhaps I could provide a sample app to show how it spins.\n"

        "body": "Hi @apotonick ,\n\nthanks for your response! Not sure yet about the second layout, but I've seen the context object and `tap` approach. I've played with it a bit, I mean `Comment::Cell.new(comment).().tap { |cell| }` and it might be useful in some cases, but I recognize it as a \"postprocessing\" step, since the `Comment::Cell` is already rendered here. I've tweaked it a bit to be able to render nested, eg:\n\n```\n    content = concept(\"main/cell\", ctxt).tap do |parent|\n      parent.show do\n        concept(\"documents/cell\",\n                cell_ctxt(with: {blah: op.contract}))\n      end\n    end\n\n    render text: content, layout: true\n```\n\nand main_cell:\n\n```\nclass Main::Cell < Isa::Cell::Concept\n  attr_reader :result\n\n  def to_s\n    result\n  end\n\n  def show(&block)\n    @result = render view: :main, &block\n  end\nend\n```\n\nYou may wonder WTF and yes, it somewhat still uses a blocks :-) .\n\nWhat I want to achieve here is to separate responsibilities of cells. At first (a couple weeks ago) my intention was to render a \"super cell\" (with a _super context_ to meet all cells dependencies) which also renders all nested cells (if exist). \n\nNow I've changed the approach because it mixins the concerns, e.g a subcell should be aware only of the context (an arbitrary object) you put into it. It doesn't need to know who is its parent. However, the parent cell is responsible of rendering its children within a layout, no matter whether its a horizontal, vertical or a mix of these two.\n\nBesides, I'd be really grateful if you'd explain [this](https://github.com/apotonick/cells/blob/master/test/context_test.rb#L22). I mean what should be the result of calling `cell.cell(\"context_test/child\", \"\")` ? Such `child` cell is nested in parent? Nontheless, the API here is much better, because it is simple `smth.cell('blah')`, however I wonder how it's supposed to work. \n"

I've set it up as shown in the [test](https://github.com/apotonick/cells/blob/master/test/layout_test.rb#L60) and it spins fine. :fire: \n\nThere's one caveat, however, because what if you have smth like `render(view: :content) + render(view: :sidebar)`? The `render_to_string` from [external](https://github.com/apotonick/cells/blob/master/lib/cell/layout.rb#L23) module is used any time render is performed and hence, the result is that each render is wrapped with layout cell, which is not expected behaviour.

However, I think there should be an intermediate interface that would allow one to use any present method (`show`, `present` or whatever). The point here is that `layout.new(model, context: context, content: content)` needs to get appropriate `content`. \n\nNote that [`ViewModel#to_s`](https://github.com/apotonick/cells/blob/master/lib/cell/view_model.rb#L131) is overidden with `call`, so why not to just override call method? e.g:\n\n```\nmodule Layout\n  def call(*args)\n     content = super\n     layout.new(model, context: context, content: content)\n  end\nend\n```\n\nWould it work? Sorry, but didn't have time to test it.\n"

I solved it by never using simply `render` but always specifying the name of the template. e.g. `render \"show\"`, (i.e. the `if options.nil?` block in my monkey patch is now broken so I avoid it). I have not tried the Cocoon::Cells Helper yet but will do soon as I'm keen to remove the monkey patch from my code. How did you go with the Helper, did it work for you?\n"

Besides that, checking object types is something I avoid everywhere I can, just because I don't want to limit people's use of my libraries. The overuse of `is_a?` is something that's always bitten me in Rails, it's not a good practice to do so.\n\nInstead, I'll wait until Ruby gets static typing (which will be in about 10 yrs, hahaha). Does that make sense?\n\nThanks anyway, and good to hear you like it!\n"

That was a red herring above.\n\nThe problem is that for a collection the options all end up in `model`, but in cells-rails options is initialised in the rails helper:\n\n```\n    options[:context] ||= {}\n    options[:context][:controller] = self\n```\n\nThen in cells there's this bit of code in Cells (lib/cell/view_model.rb) where it merges the options for a collection\n\n```\n  def call(model=nil, options={}, &block)\n    if model.is_a?(Hash) and array = model[:collection]\n      return Collection.new(array, model.merge(options), self)\n    end\n\n    build(model, options)\n  end\n```\n\nThe problem is that both `model` and `options` contain a `context` key so one of them gets overwritten, rather than merged.\n\nA possible fix would be this:\n\n```\n    def call(model=nil, options={}, &block)\n      if model.is_a?(Hash) and array = model[:collection]\n        merged_context = (model[:context] || {}).merge(options[:context])\n\n        merged_options = model.merge(options)\n        merged_options[:context] = merged_context\n\n        return Collection.new(array, merged_options, self)\n      end\n\n      build(model, options)\n    end\n```\n"

I can still only make my code work if I include `inherit = false` in the const_get options, as I mentioned in the trailblazer chatroom.\n\nBizarrely, once there has been a single call to const_get with `inherit = false` then all subsequent calls to const_get work just fine, even if I do `inherit = true`.  I think this, in combination with Spring, was why I failed to notice this before.\n\nI am still unable to reproduce this behaviour in a test :(\n"

I'll need to remove it and run it again to remember which ones they were.\n\n@apotonick , @timoschilling I don't proposing that we merge this PR in it's current state, I threw it together - along with the rough test case - to demonstrate the _bug_ in collection handling ;)\n\nLike I said it could be argued that the bug is on the boundary between cells and cells-rails - hence why my proposed fix is currently in cells and the test case is in cells-rails.\n\nI'm happy to try to explain this again, but if you run the test case above you'll instantly see the problem!\n\nAnd then I'd a steer as to where this should be fixed, and I'll tidy up this PR.\n"

In fact, it solved the issue!... _ish_. I'm now stuck on Cells generating incorrect form elements where input elements are siblings to the form element, as described in #260. I can make a new issue to pursue a solution for this, but I take it you don't have this problem?\n\n@apotonick I've experimented with an upgrade but there's a version conflict error when I just target `cells` so I've only successfully upgraded by deleting the `.lock` file which also lets in a ton of other updates. I'm introducing Cells to better manage our complexity and put us on a sane(er) upgrade path, but for now I'm not sure I can proceed.. Does 4.1 specifically address issues surrounding forms?\n"

I've been unable to include `cells-rails` gem because it requires cells 4.1, and the furthest I've gotten with 4.1 is that the server starts but `cell` helper raises `wrong constant name` for all existing cells (so far I've been using version 4.0.5 and just `cells-haml` gem).\n\nThere's probably some way through all this that I don't know about yet, but unless you're spotting something obvious I don't mean to drag you into debugging our setup. For now I'll park my Cells branch and loop back to this when I can upgrade with confidence.\n"

It should be \nhttp://trailblazer.to/gems/cells/testing.html#optional-controller\n\n/EDIT:\nhttps://github.com/apotonick/rspec-cells#api\n\n```\nURL helpers\nIf your cells use helpers with controller dependency, you need to specify a controller to use in your test.\n```\n\nI have tried \n\n``` ruby\nRSpec.describe NavCell, type: :cell do\n  controller ApplicationController\n```\n\nbut this doesn't help.... \n\nI don't think this is a Cells issue, but more how Rspec instantiates the Rails environment (or doesn't).\n\nCurrently using the helper module I found here:\nhttp://stackoverflow.com/questions/16720514/how-to-use-url-helpers-in-lib-modules-and-set-host-for-multiple-environments\nIt's not a great solution but it seems to be working as a workaround. \n\nIf you can enlighten me on what includes etc. I need in my cell to make it _just work_ without this helper, that'd be wonderful :) \n"

This allowed bundler to upgrade:\n\n```\n  cells (~> 4.1)!\n  cells-haml!\n  cells-rails\n```\n\nBut the result is the same [as my previous attempt](https://github.com/apotonick/cells/issues/426#issuecomment-240867544), pages that uses widgets raise a `wrong constant name` error (and these pages worked prior to the upgrade).\n\nThe locally-altered-hack is not sustainable in the long run anyway, so I'll be backing out of this and phasing out our use of `Cells` for the time being. Maybe once we complete our upgrades I can loop back around. Thanks for the help, and of course if you spot something I should try I'm happy to keep experimenting in my branch.\n"

        "body": "Hmmm...I'm getting a similar problem but when I pass a block to a `link_to` helper in my view (if I don't pass a block it seems fine). This only breaks the specs, but it's fine in a real environment. Using Cells 4.1.5, Cells-Rails 0.0.6, and Cells-Slim 0.0.5\r\n\r\nMy cell class\r\n```ruby\r\nclass EventProposal::IndexCell < Cell::ViewModel\r\n    # I have to manually include this stuff for my specs to pass\r\n    # even though it's supposed to be already handled by cells-rails\r\n    include ActionView::Helpers::FormHelper\r\n    include Cell::RailsExtensions::HelpersAreShit\r\n    include Cell::Slim\r\n\r\n    def show\r\n        render\r\n    end\r\n```\r\n\r\nAnd when the specs break, this is what I get\r\n\r\n```ruby\r\nEventProposal::IndexCell#show when the current user is an osl admin \r\n      Failure/Error: = link_to '' do\r\n\r\n      NoMethodError:\r\n        undefined method `output_buffer=' for #<EventProposal::IndexCell:0x0055c0836bedd0>\r\n        Did you mean?  output_buffer\r\n      # app/cells/event_proposal/index/show.slim:1:in `block in singleton class'\r\n      # app/cells/event_proposal/index/show.slim:-2:in `instance_eval'\r\n      # app/cells/event_proposal/index/show.slim:-2:in `singleton class'\r\n      # app/cells/event_proposal/index/show.slim:-4:in `__tilt_47142621548820'\r\n      # ./app/cells/event_proposal/index_cell.rb:16:in `show'\r\n      # ./spec/cells/event_proposal/index_cell_spec.rb:98:in `block (4 levels) in <top (required)>'\r\n      # ./spec/cells/event_proposal/index_cell_spec.rb:102:in `block (4 levels) in <top (required)>'\r\n      # ------------------\r\n      # --- Caused by: ---\r\n      # NoMethodError:\r\n      #   undefined method `output_buffer=' for #<EventProposal::IndexCell:0x0055c0836bedd0>\r\n      #   Did you mean?  output_buffer\r\n      #   app/cells/event_proposal/index/show.slim:1:in `block in singleton class'\r\n```\r\nSo I realize `Cell::Slim::Rails::Helpers` is supposed to override Rails' shitty capture helper, but for some reason the order of the module inclusion in the testing environment is such that I get `ActionView::Helpers::CaptureHelper` before `Cell::Slim::Rails::Helpers` in the list of included modules. So I'm basically getting this:\r\n\r\n```ruby\r\n# real environment, inside the template\r\n= raise self.class.included_modules.inspect\r\n[... Cell::Slim::Rails::Helpers, ...ActionView::Helpers::CaptureHelper, ...]\r\n\r\n# test environment, inside the template\r\n= raise self.class.included_modules.inspect\r\n[...ActionView::Helpers::CaptureHelper, ...Cell::Slim::Rails::Helpers, ]\r\n```\r\n\r\nQuick and dirty fix is to do this in my specs:\r\n\r\n```ruby\r\nbefore do\r\n   described_class.class_eval do\r\n      prepend Cell::Slim\r\n      prepend Cell::RailsExtensions::HelpersAreShit\r\n   end\r\nend\r\n```\r\nbut I hope you can shed light on why the module inclusion order is different in the test environment? (I should add also that this seems to only happen after I add in `config/application.rb` a line to specify cells with assets `config.cells.with_assets = ['event_proposal/index_cell']`. Everything was fine and dandy before that)\r\n\r\n(thanks for opening my eyes to the wonderful mess that is the Rails helper system)"

Instantiated a cell from within another cell and passed in a context hash but the 'child' cell's context was overridden to the parent cell's context instead so the extra context was lost. Seemed a bit counterintuitive - I was expecting an overwrite (i.e. child cell would get the explicit context or a merger of the parent's context and the supplied context), but not for it to be silently ignored. Ended up using the options hash instead. "

        "body": "We've also talked about merging `Cell::ViewModel` and `Trailblazer::Cell` into a single class. This would also mean merging `cells` and `trailblazer-cells`, which I think only makes sense as it's confusing to have two gems, and `trailblazer-cells` is only a [single file](https://github.com/trailblazer/trailblazer-cells/blob/master/lib/trailblazer/cell.rb) with less than 50 LOC.\r\n\r\nIf these two classes are merged, will the new class be called `Cell::ViewModel` or `Trailblazer::Cell`? I think it makes sense to stick with `Cell::ViewModel` and consign `Trailblazer::Cell` to the dustbin. This follows the pattern set by other TRB gems - e.g. `disposable` and `reform` use classes called `Disposable:*` and `Reform::*`, not `Trailblazer::Disposable` and `Trailblazer::Reform`.\r\n\r\nOr perhaps it would reduce confusion by scrapping both old names, and using a new constant name for 5.0? `Cells::Cell`? `Cells::ViewModel`? `Cell::Model`? `Cell::View`? (I like the idea of using `Cells` instead of `Cell` as the outermost namespace as it's more conventional to have the top-level namespace be the same as the name of the gem.)\r\n\r\nWhatever the case, if one or both of the existing classes is going to be removed I think a new `4.X` version should be released that includes deprecation warnings for anyone trying to use the outdated class."

        "body": "> remove cell(:name) calls in favour of MyCellClass.()\r\n\r\nIf you're talking about passing a string to the `cell` helper (e.g. `cell('song')` to render `SongCell`), my commits above already remove this. But you can still pass the constant to the `cell` helper directly: `cell(SongCell)`. Why do you want to remove this? If you're using cells with rails, `SongCell.()` can't be used as a drop-in replacement for `cell(SongCell)`, because the `cell` helper also passes in the `controller` context (so that the cell can access things like routes.)\r\n\r\n> remove :collection magic rendering as it leads to ugly code instead of simply opening a table/list and use my_objects.each + render call in a template\r\n\r\nWhat's wrong with `collection`? I use this all the time. `cell(SongCell, collection: songs)` is much cleaner and simpler than `songs.each { |song| SongCell.() }` if you ask me, plus the `Collection` class has extra functionality e.g. `join`.\r\n\r\n> allow explizit params for a cells call() method, as an options hash is hard to track, and sometimes i dont have a model so the first arg is nil\r\n\r\nNot sure what you mean by \"explicit\" params - what's your suggested syntax for this? I opened a PR for an `option` class method at #449 - is this the kind of thing you're talking about?"

        "body": "> remove cell(:name) calls in favour of MyCellClass.()\r\n\r\nI dont use any link_to magic anymore and voted for plain links like %a{href:\"/my/area/{model.id\"}. Same goes for form_for & field_helpers, where plain HAML is a decent fit and much more stable between rails upgrades (e.g. renaming of form/field-ids where your js depend on). So i tried to decouple my views from rails(helpers) as much as possible, but of course i do understand the necessity to keep it around. The cell() helper to wrap the rails controller context could f.ex be moved to the cell-rails gem. \r\n\r\n\r\n>  :collection magic rendering \r\n\r\nThe usage might be a personal taste. When not using cell() it does impose a call like MyCell.(nil, collection: xy). Maybe there is a chance to outsource it into a module, so one can opt-in to use it and the default cell() wrapper has it already included.\r\n\r\n> explizit params\r\n\r\nThrowing whatever into the options parameter is convenient but gets really dirty when you start passing them from one cell to another, where each cell requires a different part of them. Atm. i try to comment the required options as much as possible or raise if something is missing. Rails 5.1 move to ActionParams (which also has its positive effects) and the habit to add controller/action names to the request params lead me to avoid juggling with params and just use&pass the required parts: MyCell.(an_object, user: current_user).\r\nI could imagine a structure like:\r\n\r\n```ruby\r\nclass MyCell\r\n   include Cells::Render\r\n   extend Cells::Cache\r\n   include Maybe::SomeRailsNumberHelper\r\n\r\n # The params can be commented, used for lookup by autocompletes in IDE's,\r\n # transparently set defaults and use 'jump-to-definition' in IDE\r\n # @param [MyModel] model a single product\r\n # @param [User] user product owner\r\n # @return ..\r\n  def call(model, user, another='default')\r\n    # do stuff\r\n    render\r\n  end\r\nend\r\n\r\n# VS my current approach where i have no chance to directly comment e.g. the \r\n# model type (+ options hash inject in by my own base class)\r\n  class Index < ApplicationCell\r\n    include PaginationHelper\r\n    \r\n   # no params needed .. half a year later .. which params are needed? What's the model kind? \r\n    def show\r\n      @scope  = options[:scope] || :my\r\n      @filter = options[:filter] # required\r\n      @org    = options[:org] if options[:org]\r\n      render\r\n    end\r\n  end\r\n\r\n``` \r\n\r\nFor me it boils down to having a slim(fast) 'rendering' toolbox. I can give some more insights on my usage and how i moved from ActionView -> cell(:xy) -> MyCell.() and using Rails now mostly for controller/routes/models. But dont know if this ticket is a good fit for it.\r\nResult can be seen https://app.reimbursement.info/icds/F10-F19 where f.ex. each box in the body is cell\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n "

        "body": "Hmmm, I suppose when it comes to rendering collections, it is a bit strange using the \"magic\" option `:collection`. (It also means that you can't have a normal option called `collection`, although I doubt that trips many people up.)\r\n\r\nAlternative idea: render a collection by calling a class method on the cell instead?\r\n\r\nSo e.g. the syntax could be:\r\n\r\n```ruby\r\nMyCell.for_collection(x)\r\n# instead of\r\nMyCell.(nil, collection: x)\r\n```\r\n\r\n... which does feel a bit cleaner to me. If we're going to keep the `cell` helper around, then a second helper called `collection` could also be added which calls the `for_collection` method instead of `MyCell.call`.\r\n\r\nI'll write some more later about context/routes/links and param comments later when I have the time."

Also, I tried including it anyways and got another error: `uninitialized constant Cell::Erb` (even though I have `spec.add_dependency \"cells-erb\", \"~> 0.1\"` in my gemspec).\r\n\r\n@ElliottAYoung Is the project you are working on public? I'm also trying to create an Engine as a gem that uses Cells and any guidance would be really helpful. It would be great, if you could point out resources you used to find out best practices etc.\r\n\r\nEDIT: i fixed it, I needed to do the `include Cell::Erb` but was missing a `require \"cell/erb\"`"

Maybe the engine is not aware of the load path where your gem's cells sit, and you need to add it to the engine's configuration. Rails engines are a great idea, but the implementation is quite limited to Rails-only files (e.g. models).\r\n\r\n@rafaelfranca can you help us?

        "body": "Hi Greg,\r\n\r\nrendering partials in a cell is a hack, and we only support it so \"application partials\" can be rendered by the developers of the cell calling `render partial: ...`. This is to help people move from monolithic view architectures to cells.\r\n\r\nHaving that said, I'm afraid using your Alchemy helpers in the cell is the wrong approach. We could make the rendering of the partial work, but then, other dependencies might be missing, and so on. The problem is that normal Rails helpers are designed without any interfaces and do access global state, use `capture` etc. and unfortunately, most gems build on top of that ~crap~ lack of API, which I personally do not understand, but, yeah.\r\n\r\nTo get that partial rendering working, you can hack the cell's `render` method the way we do it in the `partial.rb` file - let me know if that works or not!"

        "body": "Thanks for the tips, @apotonick!\r\n\r\nI've looked into this more over the last few days. I think you are right about the issues with partials and helpers. Alchemy uses helpers for everything, including capture. This results in missing dependency after dependency. I've decided to just use the 'standard' Rails approach to get through this project :/. \r\n\r\nGiven the amount of work needed to make this work via monkey patching, I think a better solution would be to enhance Alchemy to use Cells rather than helpers. A project for another day :).\r\n\r\nThanks for the help! Will close now since this is not an issue with Cells but more an external gem limitation."

By your suggestion, it seems that for this example I would have to write 3 additional objects (one for each item content) or am I missing something?"

        "body": "Same problem over here. I have cells-rails included in my project and I have a Cell which sometimes is rendered from a view/controller, and sometimes from a model (in a background job). In this cell I am using the high_chart helper from the [lazy_high_charts](https://github.com/michelson/lazy_high_charts) gem. This gem does a check somewhere if there is an xhr request going on, and uses the request object for that: https://github.com/michelson/lazy_high_charts/blob/f7d4d1614816c98d81d9d7d387d4b6e0a9901d05/lib/lazy_high_charts/layout_helper.rb#L76\r\n\r\nNow rendering the cell from the model fails, because request delegates to parent_controller, which isn't available at that point. Full error and backtrace:\r\n\r\n```\r\nNoMethodError: undefined method `[]' for nil:NilClass\r\n/gems/2.4.0/gems/cells-rails-0.0.8/lib/cell/rails.rb:58:in `parent_controller'\r\n/2.4.0/forwardable.rb:223:in `request'\r\n/gems/2.4.0/bundler/gems/lazy_high_charts-c21849e7e1f4/lib/lazy_high_charts/layout_helper.rb:77:in `request_is_xhr?'\r\n/gems/2.4.0/bundler/gems/lazy_high_charts-c21849e7e1f4/lib/lazy_high_charts/layout_helper.rb:95:in `encapsulate_js'\r\n/gems/2.4.0/bundler/gems/lazy_high_charts-c21849e7e1f4/lib/lazy_high_charts/layout_helper.rb:40:in `build_html_output'\r\n/gems/2.4.0/bundler/gems/lazy_high_charts-c21849e7e1f4/lib/lazy_high_charts/layout_helper.rb:24:in `high_graph'\r\n/gems/2.4.0/bundler/gems/lazy_high_charts-c21849e7e1f4/lib/lazy_high_charts/layout_helper.rb:10:in `high_chart'\r\napp/cells/analysis/chart.slim:2:in `block in singleton class'\r\napp/cells/analysis/chart.slim:-2:in `instance_eval'\r\napp/cells/analysis/chart.slim:-2:in `singleton class'\r\napp/cells/analysis/chart.slim:-5:in `__tilt_70304215070660'\r\n/gems/2.4.0/gems/tilt-2.0.8/lib/tilt/template.rb:170:in `call'\r\n/gems/2.4.0/gems/tilt-2.0.8/lib/tilt/template.rb:170:in `evaluate'\r\n/gems/2.4.0/gems/tilt-2.0.8/lib/tilt/template.rb:109:in `render'\r\n/gems/2.4.0/gems/cells-4.1.7/lib/cell/view_model.rb:118:in `render_template'\r\n/gems/2.4.0/gems/cells-slim-0.0.5/lib/cell/slim.rb:8:in `render_template'\r\n/gems/2.4.0/gems/cells-4.1.7/lib/cell/view_model.rb:110:in `render_to_string'\r\n/gems/2.4.0/gems/cells-4.1.7/lib/cell/layout.rb:23:in `render_to_string'\r\n/gems/2.4.0/gems/cells-4.1.7/lib/cell/view_model.rb:104:in `render'\r\napp/cells/analysis_cell.rb:189:in `chart'\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe error happens, because context isn't set, thus it can't determine the parent_controller. I could give a context when calling the cell, i.e. `context: { controller: :some_controller }`, but that doesn't fix the error. Now I get a `NoMethodError: undefined method `request' for :some_controller:Symbol`.\r\n\r\nI think the problem is that cells-rails defines request (which crashes when calling it), tricking lazy_high_charts into thinking there is an actual request going on, while there isn't. I can perfectly use lazy_high_charts from within a model/job or even just in a Rails console (no controller/request there), but not when I use it within a cell.\r\n\r\nUPDATE: created a new issue for this problem: https://github.com/trailblazer/cells-rails/issues/50"
