The hard part, then, is how to make those other two columns accessible. Popovers or slide-in panels would probably be best for those.\n"

No clues about the SSL status in the app or logs though... it would help if we added something.\n\nOne issue I have, that should be rectified before we merge this into master: the UI has a blank input for the port, implying that the field requires input... there's no hint that it will supply the correct port if you leave it blank. I'd like to see that change so the port is pre-filled (and switches automatically when you check/uncheck SSL).\n\nAnother request: I think the port input and SSL checkbox should be combined onto the same line in the UI, as the port field doesn't need that much space. Should be easy with `.form-inline`: http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/base-css.html#forms\n"

I guess the Node IRC library is just being safe by default. I haven't looked at the `irc` module's code in depth, but if passing `selfSigned` as `true` for all connections doesn't cause a complaint against a properly SSL'd server, then Subway is no worse than i.e. Colloquy or irssi.\n\nIt might be nice to warn the user when connecting to a server that uses a self-signed cert, in case they are particularly security conscious. I think that would be the ideal UX for expired certs as well - let the user choose whether to continue connecting.\n"

You can find the commit here: https://github.com/maikelwever/subway/commit/da7af0d8cd159a0bb417917020339e3024c70385\n\nHow does this work:\n- Before logging in to IRC, go to the settings screen and press the green button. Chrome will now ask you for permission on the current domain to send notifications.\n- Join IRC and PROFIT!\n\nThe current implementation notifies on PM and mentions, in which case it will show a notification for 5 seconds (hardcoded at the moment). It uses document.webkitHidden to determine if subway is not visible for the user, in which case a notification will be sent. This is to prevent loads of messages while you are looking at the screen.\n\nIn some time I will submit a pull-request to get this feature into master. If you think this commit needs work before that, please let me know.\n"

        "body": "Hi,\n\nAs shown in issue #134 we managed to run subway behind a nginx reverse proxy.\nHowever, subway is unaware of that and still requires static assets from its hardcoded base directory.\n\nFor this reason, accessing it via a location managed by nginx is impossible (ie. example.com/subway) and only the base / location is functional.\n\nPlz correct me if i'm wrong or if you have some workaround.\nIn the meantime i'll try to implement a solution in my fork\n"

Besides that, we can adjust it with the `irc-colors.css` file.\n\nI don't know if I changed the models accordingly, or even if it is needed, so if you could check if it is ok I sould be glad.\n\nEverything is okay now, after seeing some bugs I adjusted the Pull Request. I am tuning the `irc-colors.css` now to match our client interface best needs.\n\nWhat do you think?\n"

I love the focus on making subway more accessible to non-technical people. \n\nI have a question though with regards to the `presets.password` variable and its meaning? I mean, it is obviously not referring to a channel password - since one can preset multiple channels? And we don't want to preset user-password either, now do we? :-)\n\nAlso, when we are talking about passwords. It is not possible to preset a channel with a password - or it is possible if one writes `channels: [\"#channelname password\", \"#anotherchannel foobar\"]`, but perhaps a solution such as: \n\n```\nchannels: [{ name: \"#channelname\", password: \"password\"}, {name: \"#anotherchannel\", password: \"\"}] \n```\n\nis better?\n"

When we have multiple networks per account it would also be nice to have the username and network address stay on the top(scroll the channels 'under' them) until the next network reaches the top.\n"

        "body": "I've been looking on the following implementation of a sidebar:\nhttp://startbootstrap.com/templates/simple-sidebar.html\n\nWorks pretty good actually, the problem however is that I'm not able to create fixed elements inside the content area, at least not with my average CSS-skills. In fact we probably want two sidebars, one on each side: left one for channels and right ones for userlist. Then a responsive stylesheet that just hides/show them at given widths with a toggle-button as the site provided above has.\n\nIf anyone want to take a look at my code for upgrading to bootstrap 3 and in the same time enabling scrollable sidebar/content-view, please see my branch which is very much half-working and not done:\nhttps://github.com/hermansc/subway/commit/1b975a88af8223c7316552e0fab4f08230eafd50\n\nTry comparing the layout in my commit, with the current layout, by re-sizing the window etc. Hopefully, with the \"new\" layout, which uses the principle of the sidebar-example given above, should be more deterministic and fluid.\n\nCheers. \n"

After the client can is fully functional, I'll work on adding persistence and then polishing up the UI.\n"
