I took that as a long-needed kick-in-the-ass to give it some proper documentation, which is now in there as of 1171474a48f3e61afcf16d47295487939750ca78.\n\nTake a look at the way everything is formatted in my patch; you may want to use that as a starting point for any more docs you write. I'm following Apple's conventions for style, content, and formatting, which seems to be pretty comprehensive for how exhausting it is to write in the first place. Either way, documentation generally goes in the interface (.h), rather than in the implementation, which may contain some inline comments to clarify complicated codes.\n\nThanks again!\n"

See Issue #46 for the full discussion, but my approach was to use notifications to communicate all of the context necessary to do things like update activity indicators, or alert users about errors.\n\nA `AFIncrementalStoreContextDidFetchRemoteValues` notification will contain the associated HTTP request operation at `AFIncrementalStoreRequestOperationKey`. If it failed for some reason, its `error` field will be non-`nil`.\n\nI hope this approach works alright for you. Thanks again for your patch.\n"

        "body": "Interesting example\u2014thanks for sharing it.\n\nSo for APIs that have inconsistent formats, this method needs a way to determine what the \"meat\" of the response body is.\n\nWhen I designed this all, my thought was that you could determine this just from the response body itself. In this case, that would look like:\n\n``` objective-c\nif ([responseBody valueForKey:@\"matches\"]) {\n  return [responseBody valueForKey:@\"matches\"];\n} else {\n  // ...\n}\n```\n\nUsing the added operation would turn this into something like:\n\n``` objective-c\nif ([[operation.request.URL lastPathComponent] isEqualToString:@\"search\"]) {\n  return [responseBody valueForKey:@\"matches\"];\n} else {\n  // ...\n}\n```\n\nThat second example is inherently going to be more brittle, because now it's baking in an assumption of how the API is going to serve something. Not only that, it seems like it's generally more difficult to match the request rather than some element of the response.\n\nIt's hard to imagine too many cases where it would be nontrivial or impossible to determine what part(s) of a response object (is/are) the representation(s). \n\n> FWIW, if it were somehow impossible (e.g. unpredictable keys), there would be the potential out of overriding the response object returned in the success block on a per-request basis in the HTTP client to turn the response object into something more reasonable.\n\nIf I were to add that field, I'm worried that it would just end up being more confusing than useful. Let me know how my suggested approach works for you; I can revisit this if it's found to be overly cumbersome.\n\nThanks, @lordkev\n"

For the vast majority of cases, I think the pattern you described should work just fine.\n\nThe only case I could think of that would be tough is if the response to two different calls looked similar (or both had at least one key in common), but you wanted to use different portions of each for the representation(s). However, this is probably a pretty remote edge case, and your alternative solution of overriding the response object should work there.\n\nI'll move forward examining the response objects, but I'll let you know if I run into any issues.\n\nThanks!\n"

I cherry-picked just those lines with attribution in 18805daac907ac498c6a23c1f25d3922623bca35.\n\nAs for the rest of the changes, I'm not the biggest fan of that approach. Necessary categories on Core Data classes goes down the path of API bloat and dependencies that plagues Core Data meta-frameworks. Communicating vital state through `userInfo` like this also feels somewhat fragile.\n\nAs far as conditionally triggering network requests for inserts / updates / deletes, I think the terms of that could just be determined based on whether the client implements the optional protocol methods (or returns non-nil request, even).\n\nBlock methods for context saving would be better than the current use of notifications. Someone recently suggested that I could accomplish this with a manager object that saves the context and listens for the relevant notifications, triggering the specified blocks when appropriate. Manager as an interface to blocks from notifications seems like the best pattern in this case.\n\nAnyway, thanks again for that one fix. I'll those aforementioned changes in soon.\n"

If you don't mind waiting a day or two, I'll replace that with a more robust solution rather than patching the partial solution. Thanks!\n"

I hadn't realized that a `NSSaveChangesRequest` would have its object references removed as each one saves, although I guess that's actually a reasonably side-effect.\n\nI've merged this in with some an inline comment explaining what's going on.\n\nThere are a few things I'm worried about, but can respond to as they prove themselves out:\n- The cost of copying all of the objects. Could this ever become unreasonable to the point of affecting performance?\n- Whether there's any use in getting the resulting `NSSaveChangesRequest`, with all of the saved objects removed. If there are objects that _aren't_ saved, do they stick around in the request?\n\nThose will be something to watch out for going forward, but for now, this seems like a reasonable and useful patch. Thanks again!\n"

There seems to be a lot of similar-looking code in `-insertOrUpdateObjectsFromRepresentations:ofEntity:fromResponse:withContext:error:completionBlock:`; is there any way that your patch could be refactored to use this function? Likewise with `-updateBackingObject:withAttributeAndRelationshipValuesFromManagedObject:`; is there any overlap there?\n"

        "body": "Hi, @mattt. I've done some experiment on this issue. For the second point you ask, the answer is that whether the `[backingContext save:nil]` is executed in [here](https://github.com/AFNetworking/AFIncrementalStore/blob/master/AFIncrementalStore/AFIncrementalStore.m#L566) or not, the objects which are not saved (because of failure on remote delete request) will still be removed from `NSSaveChangesRequest`. \n\nI think a possible solution is to have a copy of `NSSaveChangesRequest`, and then before we fire up the `AFIncrementalStoreContextDidSaveRemoteValues` notification. We can iterate through the objects and check whether `- (BOOL)isInserted` or `- (BOOL)isDeleted` or `- (BOOL)isUpdated` is `NO`. If so, we can remove them from the copied `NSSaveChangesRequest` since there are successfully saved according to [documentation](http://developer.apple.com/library/ios/#documentation/Cocoa/Reference/CoreDataFramework/Classes/NSManagedObject_Class/Reference/NSManagedObject.html). \n"

I realized, though, that the `__weak` modifier on `weakChildContext` could lead to the context being released long before it will get reassigned to `strongChildContext` within the success block, since `__weak` doesn't guarantee the survival of the object in any way. Nevertheless, `__block` was intended for exactly that purpose, and it worked for me instead of `__weak`. Any other thoughts?\n"

        "body": "After refreshing my knowledge of CoreData concurrency and nested contexts, I gave debugging this deadlock mess another round, and I might have identified a serious issue: When carefully formatting the kinda messy and uncommented AFIS code of `newValueForRelationship:...`, I stumbled upon the following messages enclosing the contexts `save:` operations, whose benefit I somehow didn't get before:\n\n``` obj-c\nid observer = [[NSNotificationCenter defaultCenter] addObserverForName:NSManagedObjectContextDidSaveNotification object:strongChildContext queue:[NSOperationQueue mainQueue] usingBlock:^(NSNotification *note) {\n                            [context mergeChangesFromContextDidSaveNotification:note];\n                        }];\n\n                        // ... Saving of backing context and child context done here ...\n\n                        [[NSNotificationCenter defaultCenter] removeObserver:observer];\n```\n\nWhat happens here is that `context` will have any changes from `strongChildContext` merged in, as soon as `strongChildContext` is done saving. However, merging changes this way from one context into another is deprecated when using nested contexts, as outlined in [this quick info post](http://www.cocoanetics.com/2012/07/multi-context-coredata/) on the benefits and possible usage schemes for nested MOCs. The mentioned code, which I therefore consider as unnecessary and possibly even dangerous, might lead to more than one issue:\n1. I'm not sure if merging changes twice could lead to crashes and collisions, since saving a child context already automatically pushes the changes to the parent, merging them in. Most probably nothing would happen at all, since the changes are already in place - but we shouldn't just rely on possibilities. At least, a safe but unnecessary operation could cut down on AFIS overall performance.\n2. Furthermore this might imperil thread/queue safety, since it's not guaranteed, that `context` is running on the main queue and not on some private queue via `NSPrivateQueueConcurrencyType`.\n\nAnyway, commenting out the lines of code in question, I don't seem to hit any more deadlocks. At least, the amount of deadlocks occurring during tests with my testing app seems to have substantially diminished. I've already seen this in an older temporary fix of the deadlock issue I can't find atm, but back then I didn't get the reason for cutting out these lines of code. Now, I think I have learned and can state that removing them would definitely improve stability and decrease the number of deadlocks produced by AFIS.\n\nWould do you think? I consider my self not to be the most experienced CoreData developer, so I'm interested in your opinions on that before I hastily issue a pull request.\n"
