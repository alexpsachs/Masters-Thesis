The \"secret\" isn't really secret in applications that must client-side, such as mobile apps, desktop apps, and JavaScript apps without backends.\n\nThe Dropbox authentication model doesn't assume that the secret is actually secret. The user must approve every request to `/oauth/authorize`, which is different from Facebook's OAuth 2.0 model.\n\nIn the future, I hope there will be better messaging around the API key and \"secret\". Until then, please write awesome JavaScript apps!\n\nLast but not least, if there are any authentication improvements in the REST API, and I'm not on top of them, please file a bug!\n"

I add comments to make this clearer.\n\nThe [checkbox.js sample application](https://github.com/dropbox/dropbox-js/tree/master/samples/checkbox.js) might be helpful to look at. Its `showError` function shows a div that tells the users something went wrong and asks them to refresh the page, and I think it's a pretty reasonable strategy, at least at the prototype stage.\n\nIt is my hope that `authenticate` in `Dropbox.Client` will take care of all your OAuth needs, and you won't need to learn the specifics of OAuth to write a Dropbox application. What problems are you having with `authenticate`?\n"

In any case, you can use [localStorage](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/DOM/Storage) to store your user's credentials.\n\nThe `credentials` method in `Dropbox.Client` will give you a JSON-compliant object that you can save into localStorage using something like `localStorage.setItem('dropbox_auth', JSON.stringify(client.credentials()))`. Later, pass this object to the `Dropbox.Client` constructor to pick up from where you left, using something along the lines of `new Dropbox.Client(JSON.parse(localStorge.getItem('dropbox_auth')))`.\n\nAs a warning, once you do that, you have to come up with a strategy for dealing with expired tokens. That's the main reason why the sample apps don't store user tokens -- I didn't want the expiration logic code to get readers confused.\n"

Most of the reasons why the drivers don't store the OAuth tokens for you are historical (solved bugs), but there is one real issue left -- if you store the OAuth tokens, the user isn't \"logged out\" of your application when they log out of Dropbox.\n\nAs a workaround until I figure out a better way of logging out, set the `rememberUser: true` option when instantiating the `Dropbox.Driver.Redirect` OAuth driver.\n\n``` javascript\nclient.authDriver(new Dropbox.Drivers.Redirect({rememberUser: true}));\n```\n\nThis should do the trick in development. If you really want to push this to real users, at the very least have a \"Sign out\" button somewhere, and call `forgetCredentials()` on the OAuth driver.\n"

If my explanation makes sense, please consider sending a pull request with a documentation fix.\n\nThere are two types of files in your application, the source code, and the application data.\n\nThe _source code_ lives in `Apps/Static Web Apps/DVD Library` in _your_ Dropbox, and is publicly available at the URL generated by the [Static Web Apps console](https://dl-web.dropbox.com/spa/pjlfdak1tmznswp/powered_by.js/public/index.html). You can think of this location as a file server. For example, this is where you should put the HTML, CSS, JavaScript and images behind your application.\n\nThe _application data_ lives in `Apps/DVD Library` in _each of your users'_ Dropboxes. This is the area that you can access via `readFile` and `writeFile` calls. The tricky concept here is that each user's data is stored in their Dropbox, so you can only see your own data. On the bright side, you can get security for free, as long as you don't store your users' credentials in a central place.\n\nDoes this help?\n"

The `serviceProvider` variable holds an instance of `DropboxServiceProvider`, whose constructor takes in an API key and secret. The library seems to require a `IDropbox` instance to make actual API calls, and the provided example uses a call on `serviceProvider` to get an `IDropbox` instance. So the `IDropbox` instance does get the API key and secret.\n\nI hope this helps!\n"

I tried replacing Rhino 1.7R2 with 1.7R4 (the latest release), and the problem still persists.\n\nI looked into the source code, and filed a bug with the Rhino project.\nhttps://github.com/mozilla/rhino/issues/93\n\nAlso, I tried to run the YUI compresser on the un-minified dropbox.js, and it pops up quite a few other errors. If it all possible, I strongly recommend using [uglifyjs2](https://github.com/mishoo/UglifyJS2), or its more mature ancestor [uglifyjs](https://github.com/mishoo/UglifyJS).\n"

Unfortunately, I don't work at Dropbox anymore (I was a summer intern), so I can't make changes server code.\n\nI have forwarded your request to the appropriate developers. If they decided to add Range support, I'll leave this bug open, to track the dropbox.js support for partial reads. If I close this bug and the API gets support for partial reads, please open a new bug so I'll know to add Range support to dropbox.js.\n\nThank you!\n"

However, if `length` is specified, I default `start` to the file length minus `length`, because that's how HTTP ranges work, and because I think this is more useful. For example, if you want to read the last few kilobytes from a file, to scan for ID3 tags, the default I mentioned lets you do that without having to fetch the file's metadata. I hope specifying `start: 0` isn't too much of a pain, in return for having support for end-of-file reads.\n\nI think seeking would make sense in a higher-level API. I wanted to build a higher-level API that would come with built-in caching and object-oriented representations of files and folders, and I saved the `Dropbox` namespace for that. However, I didn't have time to make it happen, and I doubt this will happen anytime soon :(\n"

I agree that most old-school Unix developers (myself included) will recognize the commands right away, but I have yet to be convinced that most of today's Web developers fall in that category.\n\ndropbox.js roughly follows the node.js API for file access, so at least node.js developers should be familiar with it.\n\nOn the other hand, the Filesystem API is indeed something to look at! If the API doesn't get killed by Mozilla's refusal to implement it, it's worth providing a compatibility layer for it. Then higher-level libraries like filer.js can use that layer and just work.\n\nDoes this seem reasonable?\n"

Is my {downloadHack: true} option call somehow inaccurate (i triple checked it but for some reason it doesn't work) or is it not implemented ?\n2.

I'm moving to a DOM-like event API, because I need events in a couple other places as well, and this looks more standard than the filter business. master was just updated with the new API implementation, so please use it if you'd like to migrate your code early.\n"

On the bright side, I promise this is the first thing on my list once I shift my focus to node.js.\n\nUnder the hood, we're using a node library that implements the XMLHttpRequest API. The author promised to support XHR level 2 in an upcoming version. Unfortunately, that library hasn't been updated in a while.\n\nIf you can find another library that supports ArrayBuffers (and, ideally, node.js Buffer objects as well), dropbox.js could use it without any modifications -- we do feature detection everywhere. If you can point me to such a library, I'll try running the test suite against it and, if it works, I'll swap it in.\n\nSorry this has taken forever :cry:\n"

        "body": "Thank you for your feedback, Michiel!\n\nThe Dropbox API uses the OAuth1 model that has the client app establish a request token, get the user to authorize the token, and then exchange the request token for an access token.\n\nIf I understand OAuth2 implicit grant correctly, it is a bit different: the user is sent to an authorization page, and then an access token is generated. This flow is much better suited for browser apps, and in an ideal world, dropbox.js would use this flow to get a token from the Dropbox API server.\n\nUnfortunately, the API server only supports OAuth 1 at the moment, so dropbox.js implements that, and tries to insulate developers from the complexities and present an OAuth2-like interface. I will take your feedback as a sign that I'm succeeding at insulating :)\n"

        "body": "@nathanathan, thank you for your feedback!\n\nI agree that sync support would be nice to have! I looked into this in early January, and here are my findings:\n- IndexedDB is the way to go; the FileSystem API is Chrome-only, and the Firefox devs said they will not implement it\n- Chrome's IndexedDB implementation doesn't handle blobs yet, so the blob contents has to be turned into binary Strings (on Chrome-only)\n- Chrome's IndexedDB implementation crashes on large strings, so files have to be broken up into blocks; this is probably a good idea anyway\n- Chrome crashes when trying to handle blobs that have 1Gb or more data, so the sync code should use ranged reads (that's probably a good idea for large reads anyway)\n\nI explored this in my Chrome extension for downloading files to Dropbox. These bits might be reusable:\n- IndexedDB wrapper: https://github.com/pwnall/dropship-chrome/blob/master/src/coffee/dropship_list.coffee\n- Uploading code that works well with both large and small files: https://github.com/pwnall/dropship-chrome/blob/master/src/coffee/upload_controller.coffee\n\nI started working on some sync infrastructure in a branch, but I decided to prioritize making dropbox.js not suck in node.js. I hope I'll have time to revisit this.\n"

        "body": "Thanks Victor! There are a couple things I wanted to point out:\n-  Cordova and most mobile browsers do not yet support IndexedDB. However, there is a [polyfill](http://blog.nparashuram.com/2012/10/indexeddb-example-on-cordova-phonegap_12.html). There's also a [polyfill](http://ericbidelman.tumblr.com/post/21649963613/idb-filesystem-js-bringing-the-html5-filesystem-api) to add filesystem support to IndexedDB browsers.\n-  With IndexedDB it seems like it would be harder for multiple applications to share data. On android the Cordova file system API allows you to read/write almost anywhere on the sdcard. (One of the neat tricks this allows is file syncing via [DropSync](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.ttxapps.dropsync&feature=search_result#?t=W251bGwsMSwxLDEsImNvbS50dHhhcHBzLmRyb3BzeW5jIl0). It's not a perfect solution. I'd rather be able to launch syncs at specific points in time from within my app and perhaps have some custom code for resolving conflicts.)\n"

        "body": "@nathanathan Actually, since you mentioned sharing -- I forgot to mention that I'm also concerned about dealing with the same app opened in multiple tabs. IndexedDB provides transactions, but this still means that the generic sync code has to be careful about storing metadata into memory.\n\nLast, if dropbox.js provides sync, it has to work in both the browser and node.js, so the heavy logic will ideally be decoupled from the storage code, and you should be able to plug in a Filesystem API-based storage driver to replace the default IndexedDB driver.\n\nThank you for pointing me to Cordova! I heard about it before, but I thought it's a company, I didn't realize it's an ASF project. I saw they support WebSQL, so my first attempt would be to use the IndexedDB shim over WebSQL. \nhttp://nparashuram.com/IndexedDBShim/\n\nI haven't tried this out though. I think that when sync happens, the initial implementation will only support IndexedDB on desktop browsers and a database / file-system combination on node.js.\n"

Your checkbox example also works correctly but I haven't been able to isolate what the difference is (yet). The relevant line in dropbox.js that causes the error is:\n\nthis.xhr.open(this.method, this.url, true);\n\nThe code I'm using to authenticate should be correct:\n\nvar dropbox_client = new Dropbox.Client({key: 'mykeyhere', sandbox: true});\ndropbox_client.authDriver(new Dropbox.Drivers.Redirect({rememberUser: true}));\ndropbox_client.authenticate(function(error, client) {  \n     if (error) {\n        return showError(error);\n      }\n\n```\n  // store tokens for future use\n  console.log(client.credentials());\n  dropbox_auth = client.credentials();\n});\n```\n\nCheers, Stuart\n"

A common misunderstanding in JavaScript is writing code that looks like this:\n\n``` javascript\nclient.authenticate(function(error) {\n  // error handling\n});\nclient.getUserInfo(function(error, info) {\n  // error handling\n});\n// use info\nclient.readFile(..., function(error, data) {\n  // error handling\n});\n// use data\n```\n\nIn fact, because of the asynchronous nature of XHR, you have to write this:\n\n``` javascript\nclient.authenticate(function(error) {\n  // error handling\n  client.getUserInfo(function(error, info) {\n    // error handling\n    // use info\n  });\n  client.readFile(..., function(error, data) {\n    // error handling\n    // use data\n  });\n});\n```\n\nOf course, you can pull out the main body into a function.\n"

This means your code has to distinguish between the case when the user visits your page for the first time, and the case where they come back from the redirect.\n\nThe `interactive: false` option in the `authenticate()` method does that for you. So, if the user has authorized your app, you can start making API calls. If the user hasn't authorized your app, you need to call the authorize a 2nd time when they click the button, to start the redirect process. This is why two authorize calls are necessary.\n\nI'm not sure how to simplify this. The authentication process requires HTTP calls before and after the redirect, so I need you to call some method that allows dropbox.js to do the HTTP call, and that gives it a callback to report to.\n\nWhat do you think?\n"

I spent many hours today trying to get the authentication workflow working for the user the way I thought it should.\n\nI actually read the docs for the client.authenticate method, including the interactive:false flag--I just read it backwards and it confused me. I thought interactive was true by default, and that interactive meant the callback was checking in more frequently--I got this wrong.\n\nAnyway, about simplifying the API, what do you think about a usage like this?\n\n``` javascript\n// Set up dropbox\nvar dropbox = new Dropbox.client({\n  key: _encodedAppKey,\n  driver: Dropbox.Drivers.Redirect,\n  rememberUser: true,\n  authCheck: function(isAuthorized, client) {\n    if (isAuthorized) {\n      myApplication.load()\n    } else {\n      client.authenticate() // Start the user interactive redirect authentication process.\n    }\n  }\n})\n```\n\nSuggested changes:\n- `sandbox: true` by default. It's the new recommended way I think, and if folks are using defaults lets have them use the safer API\n- Droopbox.Drivers.Redirect returns an instantiated version of itself\n- `rememberUser: true` moved to the client instantiation (to the uneducated, these all look like config values on the dropbox client, why not treat them that way?)\n- HTTP call for checking authentication fired automatically if the 'authCheck' callback is specified\n\nI realize I'm ignorant about this kind of thing--I've never done security or login before. As an ignorant API user though, I can't understand the need for a 3+ step process. I would love to be able to do it in 1 step as above.\n\nI'll help if I can, I'm not sure if I have the expertise or if you're interested in this idea :)\n\nIn any case, thanks for what you've done on an awesome project--per user data stores for client side applications are an incredible piece of the puzzle. Front end developers could start building powerful applications with this.\n"

As soon as the page loads...\n    \\* create a dropbox client\n    \\* create an authDriver with rememberUser: true\n    \\* Call a non-interactive client.authenticate\n        \\* If, in the callback, client.isAuthenticated is true, show the main screen\n        \\* else, show the welcome screen (this screen has the connect to dropbox button on it)\n2. When the user hits the 'connect to dropbox' button\n    \\* Call an interactive client.authenticate\n\nI felt like on on first page load, the auth callback would find the user to be unauthenticated show the welcome screen. I felt like after interactive authentication, on the second page load, the auth callback would find the user authenticated and show the main screen. This is not the case. The overall feeling is of the app behind one step behind, but it depends how I fiddle with things. It always comes back (from either a DENY or an ACCEPT on the dropbox side) with a client.authstate of 3.\n\nHere's teh codez:\n\n``` javascript\nApp = Backbone.View.extend({\n    initialize: function() {\n        _.bindAll(this)\n        this.setElement('body')\n        this.$display = $('#View')\n        // Set up Dropbox\n        this.dropbox = new Dropbox.Client({ key: _encodedAppAPIkey, sandbox: true }) // This object is used to interface with the Dropbox user and his files\n        this.dropbox.authDriver( new Dropbox.Drivers.Redirect({ rememberUser: true }) ) // The auth driver determins how authentication will be done. No action is taken at this time\n        // Start app router\n        this.router = new SimplyDone.AppRouter(this)\n        Backbone.history.start()\n        // Pursue authentication, but don't bother the user... yet.\n        this.auth()\n    },\n\n    /**\n     * Trigger dropbox authentication\n     * @param askUser If true, it redirects the user to the dropbox site to get their permission to link with us\n     */\n    auth: function (askUser) {\n        console.log('app.auth()')\n        this.dropbox.authenticate( {interactive: askUser}, this.authCallback )\n    },\n    authCallback: function (err, client) {\n        console.log('app.authCallback')\n        if (err) { return this.dropboxErr(err) }\n        if (client.isAuthenticated()) {\n            this.show(this.Views.MAIN)\n        } else {\n            this.show(this.Views.WELCOME)\n        }\n    },\n    show: function (viewId) {\n        if (this.view) { this.view.remove() }\n        this.view = new SimplyDone[viewId]()\n        this.$display.html( this.view.el )\n    },\n})\n```\n"

My impression from the docs was it somehow saves the OAuth authentication state in Localstorage and would make further oauth GETs unnecessary (on, e.g. a page reload, or even when i'm coming back to my app after the redirect from the dropbox site where i logged in).\nwith the button code above and this setting:\n\n``` javascript\nclient.authDriver(new Dropbox.Drivers.Redirect({rememberUser: true}));\n```\n\ni still see 2 OAuth GETs after a page reload and nothing in my localstorage.\n\n(i'm on Firefox and using a self-built dropbox.js from today's master)\n"

        "body": "@paulwittmann Thank you very much for the very thorough feedback on the docs! I definitely need some help there.\n\nI think that the example is in the Snippets doc: https://github.com/dropbox/dropbox-js/blob/master/doc/snippets.md#sign-into-dropbox-button\n\nAm I right? If so, any idea on how I can do a better job of pointing to it?\n\n`rememberUser` is not well-named. I'll most likely change the API in soon. This feedback https://github.com/dropbox/dropbox-js/issues/45#issuecomment-13708661 made me start thinking, as I agree with the pain points.\n\nUntil then, `rememberUser: true` is basically \"I promise I have a button that calls signOut / signOff.\" localStorage is used all the time in the Redirect driver. When `rememberUser` is false, the OAuth access token is not stored in localStorage, so the OAuth redirect flow happens every time users visit your app's page(s). When `rememberUser` is true, the OAuth access token is stored and reused when users re-visit your app. The problem with this is that there's no _obvious_ way for the user to revoke the credentials, e.g. when leaving a shared computer, so apps have to opt into this behavior.\n\nWhen `rememberUser` is true, dropbox.js makes a `getUserInfo` to check whether cached tokens are still valid, because I don't want to tell the app that the user is signed-in, and then force it to go through an auth flow right away. Assuming no bugs in dropbox.js, you should only see one network request to `/account/info`. https://github.com/dropbox/dropbox-js/blob/1a53562f17e7f3e69af6a2ab56e938b62f3c1b96/src/drivers/browser.coffee#L53\n\nIs this what's happening, or are you seeing something else?\n"

So, when there are GET parameters attached after hashtag fragment (which doesn't conform to the URI specification), it breaks out-of box URL resolution and I need to apply dirty hacks in order to work around. \n\nWould be nice if you can fix that.\n"

Use `downloadHack` in `client.makeUrl` to get a downloadable link.\nhttp://coffeedoc.info/github/dropbox/dropbox-js/master/classes/Dropbox/Client.html#makeUrl-instance\n\nDirectories: there's no API for downloading an entire directory right now. You can scrape the preview page for the 'download zip' URL, but that's brittle. If your application also creates the public data, you can put together a JSON file with `downloadHack` URLs to all the files in a directory, and use the URL for that file, instead of using the directory's URL.\n\nDoes this help at all?\n"

A minor issue is that it causes extra traffic, and some drivers might not need it. \n\nThe major issue however is that the request token that you get might expire if the user doesn't click the button quickly. If that happens, /authorize will take them to the home screen, with a red message that says the session has expired. I'll look into the code to see how long this takes, but it popped up when I was testing things in the past.\n\nI'll try to figure out how long it takes request tokens to expire and get back with more thoughts on this patch.\n"

I'm not sure cross-popup postMessage works well on IE, and I'm also not sure this case is worth handling at all.\n\nWould you be willing to draft an implementation of this?\n\nIf what you have right now works for you, I'll probably be able to take a stab at this in a week or two.\n"

I admit I have not read any documentation, I am building a web app (all JavaScript client side), and thought a dropbox feature maybe useful, everything works as expected, except when trying to represent the token ... I always get;\n\n\"error\": \"Access token is disabled.\n\nI am clearly doing something very wrong, maybe you can point me in the right direction ... this is what I am doing;\n\nAfter successful authentication I get the token object, which seems to be in client.credentials() and is the same value as the returned token, so to check the token I have being doing this;\n\naccesstoken = client.credentials();\nclient.setCredentials(accesstoken); // to test all looks good ...\n\nthen signing off or signing out, unlinking ... I then try and represent the saved token\n\nclient = new Dropbox.Client(accesstoken);\n\nand get ... \"error\": \"Access token is disabled.\n\ntried with sandbox and full access dropbox, same result, many thanks in advance.\n"

        "body": "@glynthomas Signing off disables the access token :)\n\nsignOff / signOut is supposed to be called when the user intends to \"sign off\" from your application. This means they might be leaving a shared computer, and the computer's next user should not be able to access their data. Given all possible ways in which applications could store tokens, the only correct way of implementing \"sign off\" is to invalidate the token.\n\nOn your end, you should delete the token from localStorage, and/or any other browser-side place that stores it. Next time the user accesses your application, they should log back in.\n\nOn the other hand, if you're only using dropbox.js on the server side (e.g., in node.js), and the user's Dropbox token never leaves your server, you can rely on your own session management code for logging out users, and you can use a Dropbox token until it expires. In that case, you shouldn't call signOff / signOut on Dropbox.Client.\n\nDoes this help?\n"

Leaving a valid token in the user's browser cache or localStorage would definitely not meet the expectation of being logged out, and your app might get disabled if someone notices that and complains.\n\nIf your app is completely client-side, I see two solutions:\n1. Use Dropbox for your authentication, like the samples do.\n2. If you want to use another server, have it store the user's Dropbox token, and get it when the user is authenticated. Or you can have the server generate a per-user encryption key, and use that to store the Dropbox token in an encrypted form on the client side.\n\nDoes this help?\n"

        "body": "Hey, @dwiyatci!\n\nSorry, dropbox.js does not currently support synchronous calls.\n\nFirst off, dropbox.js relies on XMLHttpRequest, which was designed for asynchronous use. Using it in a synchronous manner would block the UI thread until the HTTP request completes, which is really bad for the users. On fast Internet connections, a Dropbox API call takes hundreds of milliseconds, so doing a few of those head-to-head means your application's tab would be completely unresponsive for seconds at a time. Most users would think something is wrong with your site, and outright close your tab!\n\nSecond, XMLHttpRequest discourages synchronous use, so some of its modern features (e.g. binary files) are not supported when the library is used synchronously. This means our code and documentation would have to become more complicated to support synchronous calling, which would mostly negate the simplicity advantages of the synchronous call model.\n\nSorry for the bad news!\n\nOn the bright side, there are some JavaScript libraries that can help you get up to speed quickly on asynchronous programming. I strongly recommend [async.js](https://github.com/caolan/async/). Tutorials such as the [html5rocks one](http://www.html5rocks.com/en/tutorials/async/deferred/) might help as well. If you can afford spending some money (or your company reimburses books) I also recommend [Pragmatic Programmer's book on async JavaScript](http://pragprog.com/book/tbajs/async-javascript).\n\nI might revisit this issue over the summer. I think synchronous XHR would make it easier to learn how to use the library, and might help with debugging. Even if I end up working on it, putting together synchronous tests will take up some time, so please don't block waiting for this to happen!\n"

After investigating my Network tab, I found that the actual error message is: **\"error\": \"A file with that name already exists at path '/test_folder'\"**. So, the code above works when I change `'/test_folder'` into `'/test_folder/test.txt'`, i.e. specifying a new name for the file is needed here in the `toPath` argument. Perhaps it's worth mentioning this in the documentation?\n\nIn addition to this, it is mentioned in the documentation of the `copy` method:\n\n> The method uses a crude heuristic to interpret the \"from\" string -- if it doesn't contain any slash (/) or dot (.) character, it is assumed to be a copy reference.\n\nYet, when I pass a copy reference (e.g. 'BpSOz2Y3bnhlcXhoZHN4Mg') as the `from` argument, this method seems to send an XHR with `from_path=BpSOz2Y3bnhlcXhoZHN4Mg` instead of `from_copy_ref=BpSOz2Y3bnhlcXhoZHN4Mg`, resulting in **\"error\": \"Path '/bpsoz2y3bnhlcxhozhn4mg' not found\"**. Could you also check on this one?\n"

        "body": "After doing some research I've discovered how Firefox OS currently does OAuth flows.\nFor example here in [parameters.js](https://github.com/mozilla-b2g/gaia/blob/master/apps/communications/contacts/oauth2/js/parameters.js#L18), which is a part of the current Contacts app. The Contacts app has a way of syncing your Facebook contacts with Firefox OS.\nYou'll see that there are external redirect endpoints defined, which are basically landing pages.\n\nThough I did try to redirect to local resources, there are security policies that will not let you do that. So it seems like if the Contacts app could not do it, it might not be possible or secure enough.\n\nI got a nice **dropbox-js** flow working on Firefox OS using an external endpoint just like the Contacts app:\n\n**main.js** (your app)\n\n``` javascript\nvar client = new Dropbox.Client({\n  key: \"KEY_HERE\",\n  sandbox: true\n});\n\nclient.authDriver(new Dropbox.Drivers.Popup({ \n  rememberUser: true, \n  receiverUrl: \"http://EXAMPLE.com/oauth_receiver.html\" \n}));\n```\n\n**oauth_receiver.html** (hosted somewhere else)\n\n``` html\n<!DOCTYPE html>\n<html lang=\"en\">\n  <head>\n    <script src=\"dropbox.js\" type=\"text/javascript\"></script>\n    <script type=\"text/javascript\">\n      Dropbox.Drivers.Popup.oauthReceiver();\n    </script>\n  </head>\n  <body>\n    <h1>Dropbox sign-in successful</h1>\n\n    <p>Please close this window.</p>\n  </body>\n</html>\n```\n\nThis is not the best solution, but I'd personally follow the built-in apps and do things the same way.\nIf anyone can think of any other way to make this work let me know.\n"

You should make some decent effort to obfuscate it, so a casual attacker can't lift the API key and secret and impersonate your application. dropbox.js has build-in obfuscation support, and the link above documents setting it up.\n\nSecond, this isn't a perfect solution. It is the best we can do for applications that need to run the OAuth flow client-side. If you're worried about security, you should use dropbox.js in node.js or another server environment, so credentials aren't exposed to clients.\n\nWe'll have a better client-side story really, really soon.\n"

        "body": "Thank you for the feedback and for the research, @vincentlaucy!\n\ndropbox.js is layered on top of an XMLHttpRequest emulation in node.js because I wanted to maximize code sharing across platforms. I'm worried that having separate code paths for node.js will make it more likely that bugs will go undetected.\n\nThat being said, if I am shown that XMLHttpRequest emulation layer has an impact on performance, I will reconsider the design.\n\nIf the only perf issue is streaming, I think that the best solution would be to implement the W3C streaming proposal in [node.xhr2](https://github.com/pwnall/node-xhr2) and add a `stream` option to `readFile`.\nhttps://dvcs.w3.org/hg/streams-api/raw-file/tip/Overview.htm\n\nHow does that sound?\n"

Looking forward to streaming in nodejs & browsers!\n\n```\n    var authHeader = \"Bearer \" + token.token;\n    var options = {\n        url: 'https://api-content.dropbox.com/1/files/dropbox/' + path,\n        headers: {\n            \"Authorization\": authHeader\n        }\n    };\n       request.get(options).pipe(someOtherStream);\n\n```\n"

If you're already using 0.10.0, can you please let me know, and I'll look into this further?\n\nI apologize for the confusion. 0.10.0 introduced some API breakage, for the first time in the history of dropbox.js, and I didn't do a good job of advertising this change. I have started thinking about how I'll do a better job in the future, and the `stable` branch is a first step in that direction.\n\nThank you very much for your patience!\n"

Not sure who registered it, because Bower has anonymous package registration, but if no one's using it and you'd rather the `dropbox` name went to a build repo instead, then that's the thread to let them know.\n\nHopefully they'll get some sort of auth system running soon.\n"

Should I still use an embedded webview for the login to get around that?\n\nAnyway, there's progress and now it's probably easier to make it working than before\nThanks! \n"

Or perhaps you can add some padding to the bottom of your app icon image?  I understand this isn't ideal though and I can see that this will cause problems for others folks as well so I'm going to pass this feedback on to the rest of the team.\n"

Once you get your app working, you know there won't be any redirect URL-related hacks to worry about.\n\nIn an ideal world, all this setup would be done for you. I planned some dropbox.js patches that will get us close to that ideal, but haven't had time to code them up. In the meantime, I'm glad you got your app working, and thank you for posting your experience here to serve as inspiration to other developers!\n"

I haven't figured out how to integrate with promises, though they've been on my mind for a while.\n\nreaddir shouldn't pass the client to the callback. If it does, it's a bug :(\nhttp://coffeedoc.info/github/dropbox/dropbox-js/master/classes/Dropbox/Client.html#readdir-instance\n\nThe idea was to have the callback give you a list of entries in the result arg, like readdir in node.js, and more metadata in other args that can be ignored. Given the promise thing, it might make more sense to leave readdir work exactly like the node.js version, and ask callers to use a different method if they want more data.\n"

Debugging against minified code is really really painful.\n\nLast, are Firefox apps downloaded and cached on the device, like Chrome apps?

The next time I tried to login, I always got the white page. Then I unlinked all users in the dropbox developer backend and I was able to login again. But the error still occured. This also happens when testing on Desktop with Chrome...\n\nIf you need more information, please tell me :)\n\nGreetings from Germany,\nAndre\n\nEdit:// Ok, well, totally my fault. I thought that I added the In-App-Browser Plugin but it seems I added it to the wrong config.xml file....\nAdding `<gap:plugin name=\"org.apache.cordova.inappbrowser\" />` to `config.xml` and using PhoneGap build helped. Now everything works fine. Thanks for this amazing project :) :+1: \n"

The XHR wrapper in dropbox.js tries to read the X-Dropbox-Metadata header all the time, and the header isn't whitelisted in the CORS heades sent by the backend server that `pollForChanges` uses.\n\nI'll sit on this for a while. I don't like making the Xhr wrapper more complicated for the sake of one method, but I do understand it must be annoying to have these warnings fill up your console.\n"

It's useful if you want to display a \"Sign in with Dropbox\" button only when necessary.

Note that even if utf8-1.txt was correctly returned as UTF-8 (however with text/html type), it's not decoded/displayed correctly on the client side. The only correctly displayed file here is utf8-2.json.\n\nTherefore I guess there are problems on both server (auto-detection = bad) and client side (not assuming UTF-8? other decoding issue?). An option to assume UTF-8 would be nice in the JavaScript library. I will try the workaround in the meantime.\n\nUsed files available here: https://www.dropbox.com/sh/rbnfahnhzf8mzt7/SlmYOzYmqQ\n"

        "body": "Hi @dwiyatci @pwnall ,\nI know this question is quite old but since I have the same kind of problem I thought it would be better to start with a comment here rather than a whole new question. I'm building a web application with AngularJS and I want to handle the asynchronous calls to the Dropbox API and I've looked some at Angulars promises. Maybe something like async.js would work better, I am open for solutions that would make me able to save the data I'm fetching from Dropbox. Right now my code looks something like this:\n\nangular.module('myModule', [])\n\n.factory('HelloWorld', function($q, $timeout) {\n    var client = new Dropbox.Client({ key: \"Xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx\" });\n\n```\nclient.authDriver(new Dropbox.AuthDriver.Redirect({\nrememberUser: true}));\nclient.authenticate(function(error, client) {\n    if (error) {\n    console.log(\"Feeeeeel fel fel!\")\n    return showError(error);\n    }\n    alert(\"Dropbox account authorized!\");\n});\nvar getMessages = function() {\n    var deferred = $q.defer();\n    var temp;\n    $timeout(function() {\n\n        client.readdir(\"/\", function(error, entries, stat1, stat2) {\n            if (error) {\n                return showError(error);  // Something went wrong.\n            }\n            deferred.resolve(entries);\n            //deferred.resolve(['Hello','world');\n        });\n        deferred.resolve(temp);\n    }, 5000);\n    return deferred.promise;\n};\n\nreturn {\n  getMessages: getMessages\n};\n```\n\n})\n.controller('HelloCtrl', function($scope, HelloWorld) {\n    $scope.messages = HelloWorld.getMessages();\n});\n\nDon't know if it's just to confusing but I'm trying to return the directories of my root folder but I don't get anything. (When the commented row returns Hello World it works. How did you solve your problem?\n"

        "body": "The line that looks suspicious is `deferred.resolve(temp)`. (`temp` is presumably undefined, but also, you're resolving your promise before anything has actually run!)\n\nAlso, why is there a 5-second timeout around this?\n\nYour `'Hello', 'world'` line seems to have a typo (missing right square bracket).\n\nIn any case, if you remove the call to `deferred.resolve(temp)`, does this code work? I don't know AngularJS at all, but from working with promises in other environments, everything looks good.\n\nIn short, my preferred code would look something like this:\n\n```\nvar getMessages = function() {\n    var deferred = $q.defer();\n    client.readdir(\"/\", function(error, entries, stat1, stat2) {\n        if (error) {\n            deferred.reject(error);\n        } else {\n            deferred.resolve(entries);\n        }\n    });\n    return deferred.promise;\n};\n```\n\n**EDIT**: Oh, just noticed your last code snippet. That looks wrong, unless AngularJS has some special handling of promises there. The typical way to use a promise would be like this:\n\n```\n// ...\n.controller('HelloCtrl', function($scope, HelloWorld) {\n    HelloWorld.getMessages().then(function (messages) {\n        $scope.messages = messages;\n    });\n});\n```\n"

Also I get zero errors in console and the data is fetched from Dropbox because I can console.log it. The problem is of course that it takes some time for the Dropbox call. If you have any other solution than using Angular(or maybe knows what is wrong) I would be open to that too. Really I just want it to work :)\n"

        "body": "Thanks, works really fine. But of course for every solution I get a new problem. Now what I want to do is to read folder directories recursively. When my user selects a folder from the list I want to read the all the directories for that folder and its subfolders. If I use the output parameter stat1 from readdir the object has an attribute contents with all the objects in that folder. I've created a function where I recursively want to read the content attribute for every subfolder and then add it the first object so that I can export and then import this data as json to my system after my user has chosen the files he wants to add from Dropbox. Code below:\n\n```\napp.factory('getFiles', function($q) {\n       return {\n          getfiles: function (dir) {\n            var deferred = $q.defer();\n\n        client.readdir(dir, function (error, entries, stat1, stat2) {\n            if (error) deferred.reject(error);\n            else deferred.resolve(stat1);\n        });\n        return deferred.promise;\n    }\n}\n});\n\napp.controller('DBController', function($scope,getFiles){       \n    getFiles.getfiles('/').then(function (entries) {\n        $scope.files = entries;\n    });\n\n$scope.listDB = function()\n{   \n    var temp;\n    getFiles.getfiles('/').then(function (stat1) {\n        $scope.dir = stat1._json;\n        setFolders($scope.dir);\n        function setFolders(current)\n        {\n            for(var i=0;i<current.contents.length;i++)\n            {\n                    console.log(current)\n                folders = current.contents;\n\n                if(folders[i].is_dir)\n                {\n                    folders[i].name = folders[i].path.replace(/\\/([^)]+)\\//,\"\");\n                    folders[i].name = folders[i].name.replace('/',\"\");\n                    temp = folders[i];\n                    getFiles.getfiles(folders[i].path).then(function(stat1) {\n                        var folderContent = stat1._json.contents;\n                        temp.content = folderContent;\n                    });\n                    setFolders(temp);\n                }\n            }\n        }\n        console.log($scope.dir);\n    });\n};\n});\n```\n\nThe problem is that current.contents is undefined the second time in the loop but when I console.log it has a contents. After reading some it seems like it takes some time for the contents to be defined. Is there any other solution reading the directories like this?\n"

Calling `signoff` disables the access token currently used but doesn't do anything about the other tokens. As long as you still have at least one valid access token for the app, you'll get the automatic redirect behavior.\n\nYou can fully unlink your account from the app by visiting https://www.dropbox.com/account/security and clicking the X next to the app. If you then link the app and then use `signoff`, you should be forced to allow the app access again the next time you try to auth. (This is because you only had one access token, and `signoff` disabled that token.)\n\nYou can also pass `force_reapprove=true` as part of your OAuth 2 redirect to always force the user to approve the app again, even if they already have.

But node-open on linux uses [xdg-open](http://portland.freedesktop.org/xdg-utils-1.0/xdg-open.html) to open a new browser window for the authorization page, so this means that if I'm running my app on a server xdg-open will try to open a browser window on the server ??\n\nDo I have to get dropbox authorization with a client side method even when I'm using dropbox.js on the server??\n"

Most importantly, every user of your app would be able to take this access token and delete all your files, upload their own private DVD collection, etc. Essentially, anyone who has access to your app now has access to your Dropbox account.\n\nThe typical model for the Dropbox API is for each user of an app to access his or her own account.\n\nI'm going to close this issue here... this is probably better suited to the Dropbox API forum: https://forums.dropbox.com/forum.php?id=5\n"

For a user to be able to see the source code and obtain the account key (it won't be my dropbox, but the client's dropbox), they would have to de-compile my app. I understand this could happen, but I think it's unlikely. \n\nThe premise of my app is my client wants me to build an app that shows all the files in their DropBox folder. During a presentation, my client can use the app to view all of their files (with cordova inappbrowser etc).

        "body": "@robertknight Can you please give me more details about this? How do I get to see the error?\n\nIs it sufficient to try to run browserify on dropbox.js, or do I need a sample app?\n\nIf the latter is the case, can you please set up a GitHub repo with a minimal application that shows the problem?\n\nI don't have enough information yet, but I think that patching dropbox.js to use the browserify `require` would be sub-optimal. The XHR code in dropbox.js is carefully crafted to work around browser incompatibilities, so it'd be better to have dropbox.js recognize that it's running in a browser than to have it use `node-xhr2` on top of browserify's shim for the `http` library in node.js.\n"

In a nutshell, it started out as a Hack Week project.\n\nI was supposed to figure out what needs to happen to turn this into an officially supported library last summer, but didn't manage to do that before my internship ran out. Sorry :/\n\nThat being said, the library is fully documented, has pretty strong automated tests, and is available via npm and cdnjs. Is there something missing that you think you'd get in an official release? If so, please open specific issues, and I'll do my best to cover the gaps. Thank you!\n"

If it is tested, it is most likely that the tests use the same infrastructure as dropbox.js, so you can use [the package.json in this repository](https://github.com/dropbox/dropbox-js/blob/stable/package.json). Right now, this means you only need the `xhr2` npm package and the `open` package.\n"

I tried that but somehow npm refused to run post install hooks on my (unpublished) fork. I'll retry that or just use 641803d.\n\nI'd like to write down some documentation about how to write an AuthDriver for node apps using express and contribute that as a new PR. Is that cool for you or should i do this somewhere else?\n"

So until you release a new version i have to add `cd ./node-modules/dropbox/ && npm install` as a postinstall hook.\n(Right now im using my fork from this PR, but i'll change that)\n\nI don't like the fact that i have to care about the compilation of dependencies on my own.\nBut i see that this is a problem of npm and not of dropbox :)\n\nThanks a lot for your help ;)\n"

I have to admit I am no eventListener expert, but I can gather no reading from dbXhr.xhr.upload.onprogress.\n\nMy research tells me this is a standard action in XMLHttpRequest. I am still searching for the right way to do this.\n\nCurrently my code looks like this:\n\n``` javascript\nvar xhrListener = function(dbXhr) {\n  dbXhr.xhr.upload.addEventListener(\"progress\", function(event) {\n    // event.loaded bytes received, event.total bytes must be received\n    console.log(event);\n  });\n  return true;  // otherwise, the XMLHttpRequest is canceled\n};\nclient.onXhr.addListener(xhrListener);\n\n\nclient.writeFile(ret, data, function(error, stat) { \n```\n\n\"event\" is never logged.\n"

A new window opens everytime around and the extension closes. Is this the way this should be done ? This is the only complicated part I guess and I've been stuck with this for quite some time. I have been genuinely tryng to understand the API before putting this up. I try and authenticate as soon as the extension is launched - onload\n"

The problem is that during chromium packaged app development if you don't have a key in your manifest.json file the packaged app's ID can change, it will be automatically generated by Chrome when the app is loaded. You can find details on Stack Overflow: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/21497781/how-to-change-chrome-packaged-app-id-or-why-do-we-need-key-field-in-the-manifest. If you decide to let the ID change then every time it does you will have to update the OAuth callback URLs in your Dropbox app's OAuth2 Settings to match the new ID. For example:\nhttps://[your app id].chromiumapp.org/\n\nAnyway \"Authorization page could not be loaded.\" is a symptom of not configuring Dropbox with the correct OAuth 2 callback URL. Just thought anyone arriving here via search might like to know.\n"

It should call Dropbox.Client#authenticate, which drives the OAuth 2 process and calls into the driver when necessary.\n\nIn my experience, this design worked out well for client-side apps, but doesn't work for server-side code, e.g. node.js. I haven't had time to finish up a node.js app and figure out what the API should look like in that case.\n\nAre you trying to write a server-side app?\n"

I was recreating by way of reverse-engineering that process, thus needing to dive _way_ under the covers to keep things moving forward.\n\nSince I was programmatically triggering the first call instead of it merely happening on load and then trying to progress from there such that I could make API calls, the end result is that mess that I created above. :)\n\nI'm closing this, look for a PR to add a bit of documentation about using `Dropbox.Client#authenticate` as it is [not mentioned anywhere I can find](http://coffeedoc.info/github/dropbox/dropbox-js/master/classes/Dropbox/Client.html#authenticate-instance) that calling it again resumes the process.\n"

It seems like we need to amend testing instructions with directions about creating specific folders and sharing them with specific users.

        "body": "As an aside, here is an example of how I'm handling consumption of read-only API endpoints:\n\n``` js\n/* global dbclient */\nvar response = new Promise(function(resolve, reject) {\n    dbclient.metadata(path, { readDir: true }, function(error, Stat, ChildStats) {\n      ChildStats = ChildStats || [];\n      if (error) {\n        reject(error);\n      } else {\n        Stat = Stat._json;\n        Stat.contents = ChildStats.map(function(item) { return item._json; });\n        resolve(Stat);\n      }\n    });\n  });\n\n// DataLibrary.load(response);\n// response.then(function(value) { ... });\n```\n1. I wrap the entire thing in a promise. More and more data libraries are promise-aware and do the right thing when passed a promise.\n2. I shuck the `Dropbox...` object. Taking a look at your [response object example](https://github.com/dropbox/dropbox-js/blob/stable/src/file/stat.coffee) it does only a few things:\n   - Duplicatively documents the API response from the [Core API HTTP docs](https://www.dropbox.com/developers/core/docs#metadata) which can now get out of sync from the primary source.\n   - Provides instance methods for getting the original JSON back.\n   - Mild data normalization efforts in the constructor (I would argue that this should be handled by the server, not the client).\n   - Creation of a few pieces of \"composed\" information. I would argue that any API client is part of the data layer and that no transformation should be done at the data layer. Also, how do you protect users against possible future collisions?\n   - Provides a static method to get another `Dropbox.File.Stat` instance. (Tail recursion: see above thoughts.)\n3. In terms of making it easier to test I would argue that testing should only cover code up to the boundaries of the service you are consuming. In read-only endpoints this basically entails sending malformed requests and properly handling errors. With writable endpoints you can write-then-read as a way to imply correctness, but those can only be integration tests that can fail for \"third-party\" code reasons even if your code is 100% correct.\n\nI'm beginning to realize that my desires for an API client are rather different and as such I might be better-suited rolling my own. :/\n"

        "body": "Hi. Sorry to hijack this thread, but I experience a similar problem or maybe I am getting the basics wrong: \n\n**_The first time_** when I do `client.authenticate()` my AngularJS application stores the oauth token in localStorage which is fine. I can then do my request through my services and all is good. \n\n**_When I revisit the page_**, eg. reload the page, I still have the token persisted in localStorage but a direct call to `client.getAccountInfo()` results in a 401. My understanding was, that when there is a token available you don't have to re-autheticate. Calling client.isAuthenticated() yields in a `false` as well.\n\nThe token is not passed as bearer when I straight request getAccountInfo (w/o client.authenticate) although it is available in localStorage.\n\nDo I have to call `client.authenticate()` every time I want to talk with the API?\n\nAny idea?\n"

        "body": "Hello all,\n\nI would really love to see these changes merged so I decided to take a look at this PR. \n\n@ehfeng The error you're getting is a failing test because there are still some issues with the optional parameters logic. The first issue is that a cursor can be a string (which is used in the \"with a bad cursor\" test and is described in the documentation above the method). The second is that in your current PR, the last `else if` can never be executed because it is strictly more restrictive than the preceding `else if`. I think the following is a better approach for checking the optional parameters and works with the existing tests:\n\n``` coffeescript\n# Returns if a parameter was a cursor or not\nisCursor = (param) ->\n  (typeof param is 'object' and param.cursorTag) or typeof param is 'string'\n\nif (not options) and (not callback) and (typeof cursor is 'function')\n  callback = cursor\n  cursor = null\n  options = null\n# if options were not passed but cursor was passed\nelse if (not callback) and (typeof options is 'function') and isCursor(cursor)\n  callback = options\n  options = null\n# if cursor was not passed but options were passed\nelse if (not callback) and (typeof options is 'function') and not isCursor(cursor)\n  callback = options\n  cursor = null\n  options = cursor\n```\n\nI also am a little confused as to why you were allowing the options to be passed in from the cursor object or the options object. I suppose it could simplify subsequent calls to the pullChanges function (by not having to pass in options) but I'm not sure you really gain anything from that. In the diff below I took this out (as well as the storing of options in pullChanges) because you weren't passing these options into the parse method anyway (line 1128 of client.coffee).\n\nIf you're not interested in working on this anymore @ehfeng I don't mind writing some tests to make sure this works. Really looking forward to these changes!\n\n[diff file with above changes](https://dwett.com/temp/better_optional_logic.diff)\n"

Anyway, not to worry, I have solved it by rewriting the NodeServer module a little so that it is compatible with node-webkit in the sense that it now displays a popup window that closes after successful authentication. What I was wondering is, as the nodeserver is meant for automated test suites, is there any method to get the access token, like client.accesstoken(), or   do I need to build that in as well?\n\nThanks :)\n"

I always felt that the iframed Codo viewer wasn't very user-friendly anyway. (E.g. as you navigate, the browser URL doesn't change, so sharing a particular link with someone involves manual work, and then that link doesn't have the outer navigational iframes.)\n- Simply take the coffeedoc.info repo and spin up a new instance on Nodejitsu or Heroku just for the library's docs. One instance on Heroku is free (don't know about Nodejitsu). The only downside is a custom domain would cost $$.\n\nEdit: the only/main benefit of the last option over `gh-pages` is it could do the same webhook thing to automatically update based on commits, rather than manual updates to `gh-pages`.\n"

Basically, the end result declares two objects (or slight variants thereof):\n\n``` js\n  DbxEnvGlobal = global;\n  module.exports = Dropbox;\n```\n\nAs it is executing the node.js part of the `if` statement, I presume that it is meeting the following conditions:\n\n``` coffeescript\nif typeof global isnt 'undefined' and typeof module isnt 'undefined' and\n    'exports' of module\n```\n\nEven though I'm not using node.js, I'd like to use commonjs modules so I can require dropbox-js where needed in the app. Is there a way I can fix this without modifying the lib manually?\n"

It works fine on OS X.\n\nHowever on (Ubuntu 14 with Node v0.10.37), tested on 2 different machines: one on AWS and one on DigitalOcean I get the above error repeatedly until a `Maximum call stack exceeded` error.\n\nIf there's a db engineer in here let me know your SSH public key i'll give you easy access to a reproduction\n"

So on my chrome app, it looks like it's authorizing everything fine, but I still get the error `identity.launchWebAuthFlow: Authorization page could not be loaded.`. The weird part is that if I go to the URL manually that I'm getting redirected to, it's definitely the right url (i.e. it's in the form `http://<app id>.chromiumapp.org`. Any idea why? I think it's a permissioning error in the manifest or something,  but I'm having trouble finding how to actually fix it\n"
