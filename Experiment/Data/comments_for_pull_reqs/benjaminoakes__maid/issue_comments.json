        "body": "Hi @macfidelity,\n\nThanks for posting this issue; I'm happy you find Maid interesting.  The issue you mentioned is something I'd definitely like to improve, as I'm gradually switching from using Mac OS X to using Ubuntu.\n\nThe methods that are specific to OS X are listed [in the documentation](http://rubydoc.info/gems/maid/0.1.0/Maid/Tools).  They are tagged with \"Mac OS X\".  For the time being, it would be best to avoid them.\n\nThere's [some code to detect whether the host OS supports a given command](https://github.com/benjaminoakes/maid/blob/master/lib/maid/maid.rb#L92), but clearly it's less than foolproof.  As a longer term strategy, I'd like to have feature parity between OS X and Ubuntu (if possible).\n\nI'm open to alternatives, as well of course.  :smile:\n\nBest wishes,\n\nBen\n"

It's better to be safe than sorry:  I found that I was running rules accidentally far too many times.  I really didn't want that to affect someone that didn't know the default behavior (and was just trying to see if `maid` was still installed, etc).  I considered that a bug that needed to be fixed, especially as running the sample rules could have unintended consequences.\n\nBack to this issue:  any time that you used `maid` to start cleaning before, you'll need to do `maid clean` now.  It's a change, but I think a change for the better, given the above problem.  However, I hadn't run through the examples in the README; I just updated them.\n\n(In retrospect, Maid 0.1.2 might have been better named 0.2.0 according to [semantic versioning](http://semver.org/).  I'm going to try to adhere to that more closely in the future.)\n\nGiven the amount of people that have recently started using Maid, I'd like to start making beta releases before making stable releases.  Please see issue #10 for more info.\n\nThanks again for using Maid!  It's great to see that so many people are interested in it.\n\nBen\n"

(E.g., does it act differently with folders?)\n- ...duplicate names are handled differently.  (E.g., do the commands above again... do you have two `foo.txt` or just one?)\n\nIf you'd like to check that out, that'd would be very helpful!  Otherwise, I'll come back to it sometime... maybe even next week.\n\n**Sidebar:** Since we're trashing things to `~/.Trash` on Ubuntu, there will probably be a migration step where they all get moved to the right place when `v0.1.3` (\"trash-bugfixes\" milestone) comes out.  That would probably be easy to do, but I'm not sure of all the implications yet.  It would be something like this:\n\n``` bash\nmv ~/.Trash/* \"$HOME/.local/share/Trash\"\nrmdir ~/.Trash\n```\n"

That seems to go farther into OS details than Maid probably should.\n\nWhat might get implemented is:\n- If you have `trash-put` available, delegate to it.\n- If not, move to `$XDG_DATA_HOME/Trash/files` (see [Why Is There No More `~/.Trash`?](http://www.faqoverflow.com/askubuntu/13779.html)).  The user will have access to the file, but no \"restore\" functionality.\n\nThe former case could be made easier with an Ubuntu package (#3) -- it could just install `trash-cli` as a dependency.\n\nI'm still thinking about it, but the above steps would be easier to write than anything else I'm thinking of... \n\n**Bare minimum,** we'll at least move to `$XDG_DATA_HOME/Trash/files` to get the bug fixed.\n"

It's getting a little late over here.  :smile:\n\nIn the meantime:\n- I would prefer the C-style operators (`&&` and `!`) vs `and`/`not`.  (See also https://github.com/bbatsov/ruby-style-guide)  Could you change them please?\n- `trash('foo.zip', remove: 1.gigabyte)` doesn't read quite as well as I'd like (although I like the brevity).  How about...  `trash('foo.zip', remove_over: 1.gigabyte)`?  I'm open to alternatives.\n- Especially since `disk_usage` shells out and then parses the result, I'm a little nervous about files getting removed accidentally.  (I'm not sure how realistic that is, but Maid is automatically handling people's files, after all.)  Perhaps [a pure-Ruby solution](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3632074/what-is-the-fastest-way-to-calculate-disk-usage-per-customer)?  I'm still on the fence here.\n"

        "body": "Hi Larry,\n\nThanks for your contribution.  It's very appreciated!\n\nHowever, this implementation isn't entirely what I had in mind.  My apologies; the description of #27 is a little misleading.  The idea here isn't to just make `find` give the same output as `dir`, but rather _act like_ `dir` in that it gives back an `Array`.  (The calls `dir('~/Downloads')` and `find('~/Downloads')` should give quite different results.  :smile:)\n\nMy thought was that `find` could be modified to have a default block that collects the names of the files (and then that is used as the result).\n\nAlso, if possible, please make this a pull request for the `simple-tools` branch, as that's going to be used for the future release.  If it's easier to leave it on `master`, that's fine too.  I'll be happy to merge it.  :smile:\n\nThanks again for your work on this.  I'm sorry the intent was miscommunicated!\n\nBest wishes,\n\nBen\n"

        "body": "Interesting.  This would seem related to how Ruby 1.9.x handles string encodings.  (If so, we might be able to force the encoding to fix this.)\n\nI assume you're using a Mac.  I have a few questions:\n- What version of Ruby is being used?  (`ruby --version`)\n- Did you install Ruby via MacPorts?\n- Can you switch from the MacPorts Ruby to the system Ruby (1.8.7) and see if the problem still exists?  If it works fine, using 1.8.7 might be a workaround for now.\n- Can you share the zipfile that caused this problem?  (Is it something that could be downloaded for testing?)\n\nThanks for your help, and for your interest in Maid!\n\nBen\n"

Old .Trash was deleted as a result but in my case i had nothing to migrate in it - so i cant tell if that part would have worked.\n- got notification about last_accessed beeing deprecated while running ---dry-run (which is good). As a sidenote: \n  The documentation at ruby.doc.info still lists last_accessed not accessed_at.\n- i've added a new wiki-page for example rules as i think it might be a chance to start a bigger collection of working examples - from users for users. Useful idea or just not needed as maid comes with the 'sample' option?\n"

General impressions are a great thing to report here, but if we identify a bug, we should make a new issue for that.\n\nRegarding http://rubydoc.info/gems/maid/Maid/Tools, it will be updated automatically when Maid 0.1.3 is released; this prerelease doesn't update the documentation.  Thanks for reporting it; I should have noted that would be the case.\n\nThanks for the wiki page too.  It's a great supplement to the \"sample\" that Maid comes with, and is a great option so people can share ways they use Maid.  I'll be adding to that page myself sometime soon.  :smile:\n\nBen\n"

I'm about ready to stop waiting on a bugfix for XDG, so I might just release my own version of the gem to rubygems.org (e.g., `xdg-maid`) so we can get Maid v0.1.3 released.\n\nAt any rate, any feedback you can give is appreciated.

It's unfortunate that we had to go through that, but it means we can release the next version of Maid (finally).  :smile:\n\nMaid v0.1.3.beta.2 has just been released to RubyGems. Along with the dependency on the fixed version of `xdg`, Beta 2 has a tiny fix for a bug in `trash()` that I discovered.\n\nI'm planning to release Maid v0.1.3 (final) after giving a few days so others can try it out.  However, I've only heard positive feedback thus far (and several users are using Beta 1 every day), so I plan on releasing it pretty soon.  :)\n\nBest wishes,\n\nBen\n"

The benefits to having an Ubuntu package are pretty minimal at the moment, especially if it's just scripting installing the `ruby1.9.1` dependency and then running `gem install maid`.  I do like that a PPA would make software updates easier to distribute, though.\n\nRight now, I'm spending the time I have to work on Maid fixing bugs and implementing new features.  I may come back to the Ubuntu package, especially if enough users would find it useful.  In the immediate-term, I can package up a \"gem installer `deb`\" and put it under the GitHub downloads -- I've gotten that working before.\n\nI see you responded to [my question on StackOverflow](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/12233350/how-do-i-package-a-ruby-application-for-ubuntu-including-its-gem-dependencies) and have a related GitHub repo.  Any help is appreciated, as always.  There's a good chance you know more about this topic than I do.  :smile:\n"

It can be a bit of a pain to have to do it separately.\n\nNote: I'm one of those package-management-till-the-end people. Ever since I saw `apt-get`, I can't live without it! \n"

        "body": "Hi @choupachupss,\n\nThanks for writing in!  `find` does need some better documentation.  Better documentation is a goal for Maid v0.2.0 (hopefully released this coming weekend), so I'll be keeping this in mind.  You can check out the new docs here:  https://github.com/benjaminoakes/maid/blob/master/lib/maid/tools.rb#L196.  Additionally, you're very welcome to contribute tips and tricks to [the wiki](https://github.com/benjaminoakes/maid/wiki).\n\nHowever, `find` is kind of odd in that it's been less useful to me than I would have originally thought... and it tends to confuse things.  In fact, it's actually not necessary in the rule you brought up.  I would write it slightly differently, since `dir` just gives back an `Array`:\n\n``` ruby\nrule 'facebookPhoto' do\n  paths = dir('~/Downloads/*.jpg').select { |p| p.match(/[a-zA-Z]*/) }\n  move(paths, '~/Images/')\nend\n```\n\nBut that's a pretty common pattern, so Ruby actually gives you `Array#grep` to make it simpler:\n\n``` ruby\nrule 'facebookPhoto' do\n  move(dir('~/Downloads/*.jpg').grep(/[a-zA-Z]*/), '~/Images/')\nend\n```\n\n(Note: if I'm interpreting the intention of your rule correctly, that regexp may need a little tweaking.)\n\nI hope that helps!  Thanks again for using Maid.\n\nBen\n"

That would be great.  :smile:\n\nI really like how `dupes_in` and `trash all_but_the_oldest dupes` reads... but I've been wondering if there's another way to express this filtering logic in a more reusable way.  I don't have a fully formed idea about that yet, however.\n\nRather than having additional purpose-built methods for this, could we take advantage of what `Array` and `Enumerable` give us?\n\nSome pseudo-code variations on that idea:\n\n``` ruby\ntrash dir('*.png').select(&file?) # Or `trash dir('*.png').select(&files)`\ntrash dir('*.png').select(&directory?)\ntrash dir('*.png').reject(&oldest) # Same as all_but_the_oldest\ntrash dir('*.png').reject(&newest) # Same as all_but_the_newest\ntrash dir('*.png').map(&modified_at).max\ntrash dir('*.png').grep(/foo/).reject(&shortest_name)\n\ntrash dupes.reject(&oldest)\ntrash dupes.reject(&shortest_name)\n```\n\nInclude `all_but_the_oldest` and friends would definitely **not** hold up any pull request, but filtering arrays of filenames a serious thing to consider if we want code to be reusable in interesting ways.  I'd appreciate your opinion on this.  Food for thought if nothing else.  :smile:\n\nAt any rate, thank you very much for your offer to contribute!  I look forward to seeing the pull request.\n\n(Related: https://github.com/benjaminoakes/maid/issues/51)\n"

What you note about `.localized` will be included when that feature is added.\n\nAlso, the behavior you describe with `move` doesn't seem like it should be happening since there's [a check to see if the file exists](https://github.com/benjaminoakes/maid/blob/master/lib/maid/tools.rb#L37).  I've made a separate issue (#87) to see if we can reproduce that, and if we can, a bugfix release will be coming out shortly.\n"

For example `file -b --mime-type example.jpg` returns `image/jpeg`.\n\nI'd be happy to write a mimetype method and maybe a method that just returns the media_type. So, we can target image, video or other media types.\n\nI think the spotlight content_types method could still provide value to OS X users, though. The mimetype of a zip is `application/zip`, which is not as helpful for targeting general types as `public.archive` provided by spotlight.\n\nThere may be way to get a tree of types on Linux, but I don't know how.\n"

        "body": "I could certainly see including both solutions.  People have requested having more Spotlight attributes (e.g., #12) before, and I can definitely understand the usefulness of that.  (Note: [`ruby-spotlight`](https://github.com/youpy/ruby-spotlight) might be a big help, but may not be necessary right now.)\n\nHowever, if  we generalize that Spotlight feature, it might be a big win.  For example, instead of only adding `content_types()`, we could do something like:\n\n``` ruby\n# Get the kMDItemContentType for the path, converting to camel case like I do in Vertigo:\n#\n#     # something like this:\n#     name.to_s.gsub(/_([a-z])/) { $1.upcase }\n#\n# https://github.com/benjaminoakes/vertigo/blob/develop/lib/vertigo/client.rb#L78\nspotlight_attribute(path, :item_content_type)\n\n# It's general, so you could get other attributes like kMDItemAuthors:\nspotlight_attribute(path, :item_authors)\n```\n\nRegarding mime types, I'd like to avoid shelling out to use more system commands (e.g. `file`).  If we can use `MIME::Types.type_for('citydesk.xml')` to the same effect with a well tested `Ruby` library, that has less room for error in my experience.  But like I said, I don't know a lot of what the `mime-types` gem has in its API.\n\nThanks again for your help on this!  I was honestly thinking mime types were the way to go before this conversation, but I can certainly see how the Spotlight metadata would be useful now.\n\nHappy holidays,\n\nBen\n"

(When I do have time to work on Maid, I'm prioritizing bugfixes, and a release with contributions people have made.)\n\nI like the `find` solution because of what you mentioned, but it would seem like the existing `find` method would be very similar.  Because of that, Maid's `locate` might still end up using the system `locate`, but maybe with a disclaimer in the documentation, or a printed warning.\n\nThat's my current thought process at least.  :smile:  Thanks again for writing, and for using Maid of course.\n\nBen\n"

Basically, the spec should fail if [the `say` lines in `version`](https://github.com/benjaminoakes/maid/blob/master/lib/maid/app.rb#L35) are removed.\n\nIf you're interested, I've labelled some other [\"low difficulty\" issues](https://github.com/benjaminoakes/maid/issues?labels=difficulty-1&milestone=&page=1&state=open).\n\nThanks again for your work on this!

(For what it's worth, I like feature branches -- I saw you had made one in #98.)\n\nRegarding your question, I believe the answer is that we always `follow_rules`, but the rules will respect the `noop` option if `--noop` is specified.  That allows us to see what a dry run would accomplish.\n\nI've only taken a quick glance through the code so far.  One thing that occurs to me is that we should add another alias called `-f` for people who are familiar with `git clean` (which takes `-n` or `-f`).  That might be a reason to prefer `--force` over `--execute`, but allowing `--execute`, `-e`, and `-f` could make sense too.  I might tinker with that idea if you don't have a chance to. \n\nThanks again!\n\nBen\n"

Maid was not run from cron. \nSo had no error messages there.\n\nDid the cronjob logging you suggested and found out that: Command 'maid' is available in '/usr/local/bin/maid' \nand that was not in PATH. So you were right !\n\nI simply changed the crontab line to the following and it started running perfectly:\n\n*/1 \\* \\* \\* \\* /bin/bash -li -c \"/usr/local/bin/maid clean --silent\"\n\nI am just switching to Linux so seems I have  a lot to learn. (That is why I am replicating Hazel functionality with Maid)\n\nThank you !\n"

Sometimes that's because `~/.bashrc` and `~/.bash_profile` are slightly misconfigured.  Of course, if you are using something other than `bash`, it might not be configured at all.  :smile:\n\nIt's hard to debug things like that remotely, but could be worth looking into your configuration if you'd like to.

Even after reading:\nhttps://help.ubuntu.com/community/EnvironmentVariables\n\nThe PATH variable was set globally but not in .bashrc. I just added it there and now works with the tutorial crontab line as is. \n\nEven Ubuntu's documentation is not very clear for me. For local or per-user settings:\n\nA previous version of the Ubuntu page recommended ~/.pam_environment , but the page currently suggests that if that doesn't work, you should use\n\n~/.profile - This is probably the best file for placing environment variable assignments in, since it gets executed automatically by the DisplayManager during the startup process desktop session as well as by the login shell when one logs-in from the textual console.\n\n~/.bash_profile or ~./bash_login - If one of these exists, bash executes it instead of \"~/.profile\" when bash is started as a login shell. Bash will prefer ~/.bash_profile to ~/.bash_login. [...] These files won't influence a graphical session by default.\"\n\n~/.bashrc - \"... may be the easiest place to set variables\".\n\nThanks again for all the help !\nMaid works perfectly for me.\n"

Of course the the code I am using right now is not perfect at all. For example, it will rename `archive.tar.gz` to `archive.tar_1.gz`, which is wrong. But it's the idea that is important. Also, I would like to make one thing clear: I don't think there is an \"issue\" with the `move` method, I just think it can be improved.\n\nBy the way, thanks a lot for creating this awesome piece of software, it's amazing and it works very well (I'm using it on ArchLinux with no problems). :+1:\n\nAlso, as a side note, it's better imho to automate `maid` using something like [inotify-tools](https://github.com/rvoicilas/inotify-tools).\n"

        "body": "Gotcha, I see what you're going for now.  I like the idea.  I'd take a pull request, but maybe with a slightly more descriptive name like `automatic_rename`, `numbered_rename`, etc.\n\nThere's some other \"automatic naming\" features that I'd like to implement someday (e.g. looking inside a file for a date and then naming that file based on the date that was found, which would be really helpful for bank receipts).  I have some basic code for that now, but not anything worth sharing.\n\nThanks for the kind words.  Glad it helps you, and that it works on Arch.\n\nRegarding inotify, I agree.  That's being worked on too... https://github.com/benjaminoakes/maid/issues/116\n"

I mean, not the task definition API itself, which was made clear in your example, but how to execute those instructions. \n\nMy idea was to instantiate a `Maid`, wrap those instructions in a rule, and then call `#clean` on that instance. That way it wouldn\u2019t change anything in the execution flow of a task (logging it properly etc.).\n\nWhat do you think about that? Thanks!\n"

If it really is happening on directory listing there's some dtrace commands that you can run to see what process is accessing it.\n\n```\nsudo opensnoop -a -f /Users/yourname/Desktop/some-file-that-access-time-changes-a-lot\n```\n\nProblem is that slows down all file access calls.  For example creating a new tab in terminal takes several seconds where it's near instant if opensnoop isn't running.  For my case (weekly but not exactly weekly) running opensnoop until then isn't possible.  Another fun command is `sudo iosnoop -vstoD` which will show every kind (both read/write) of access for every file in the system.  Needless to say it's rather verbose but it may show a pattern.\n\nMy workaround has been to be more aggressive in the checking.  For example after 2 days screen shots are moved out of desktop (I don't delete anything so it's not a big deal to move it sooner)\n"

By that, I mean `maid` can't fail to install just because of OSX specific code existing to support the OSX-only tagging feature.  To be clear, we **don't** need to have the exact same featureset on Linux.\n- From looking at [jdberry/tag](https://github.com/jdberry/tag/), it seems like a Ruby gem that wraps it could be a very good idea.  I don't know much about taking that approach, but looking at `rb-fsevent` could be a good starting point.\n"

(Note: there's a problem with the test suite on Ruby 2.3 that I've yet to fix that's unrelated to your change.  I'd appreciate it if you want to take a stab at that though!)  That said, what I linked seems to be a real problem.\n- I'd like to see some kind of tests, even if it's just ensuring the files would be installed correctly.\n- The `install_launch_agent` method is pretty long.  Can we break it apart somehow?  (E.g. move the heredocs elsewhere.)\n"

This may cause problem with not only Korean but also Greek, Arabic, Hebrew characters. For those of you that's having similar problem, please check [this page](http://unicode.org/faq/normalization.html)\r\n\r\nHopefully there seems a number of conversion library, and those might help I presume.\r\n\r\np.s. thank you **SO** much for making and maintaining maid.
