I think we need further investigation.\n\nRegarding the daemonize method, we can provide :multiple option.\n\n``` ruby\nDaemons.daemonize(:app_name => 'redis-stat-daemon', :multiple => true)\n```\n\nthen the names of the PID files will be `redis-stat-daemon0.pid`, `redis-stat-daemon1.pid`, and so on. I'll add the option if you think it's useful.\n\nDoes one of your Redis servers require password? There was [a bug](https://github.com/junegunn/redis-stat/issues/8) where redis-stat does not re-authenticate when the server is restarted, and it was fixed in 0.3.8.\n"

        "body": "Thanks!\nThere are a couple of things I'd like to check:\n- It seems that it creates a new instance of `Elasticsearch::Client` every time it outputs the info instead of reusing one. Is it conventional? I'm not familiar with es gem, so I'm just asking.\n- `output_es` is called by `output` method, which is [only called when the process in not daemonized](https://github.com/sent-hil/redis-stat/commit/d4bcac4bc0dd3298a8f64c4f75a5cd985a2dc72f#diff-0e09d74a33a2e175d736bb807e44a686L92). I think it makes more sense that it is not disabled when daemonized. Then again I realilzed that the same thing applies to CSV output as well, which is obviously a bug.\n\n@frhwang Thanks for the comment. Could you help testing this feature? I hear that you and your team are experts in ES. :smiley: \n"

I've also tested the latest version on Arch Linux, but I just couldn't reproduce the problem. Have you tried it on a different environment like VM on your laptop?\n\nThe redirection code is [here](https://github.com/junegunn/redis-stat/blob/master/lib/redis-stat/server.rb#L34-L36). If you're willing to further help me diagnose the problem, you can clone this repository, comment out those lines, start redis-stat with `test/bin_helper.rb redis-stat --server` and check the output of the curl command.\n"

What we can do now is either to start multiple redis-stat processes or to ship the logs to ElasticSearch, but both of which seem cumbersome. I'll see what I can do when I get time.\n"

Maybe it's slightly beyond the scope of redis-stat as it was initially designed as a simple command-line tool like vmstat, iostat, etc. The `--server` option was obviously an afterthought. \n\nAnd by \"50 seconds\", you're refering to [the hard-coded `HISTORY_LENGTH`](https://github.com/junegunn/redis-stat/blob/master/lib/redis-stat/server.rb#L8), right? Since the default interval is 2 seconds, the total duration becomes 100 seconds, and you can increase the interval as you like.\n\nredis-stat currently does not allow you to change this `HISTORY_LENGTH`, but it has an option to send its logs to ElasticSearch, where you can inspect older log using tools like Kibana.\n"

        "body": "The current graphs cover about a minute or so.  That's enough to see where things are going right now so I find that useful.  It would be nice if there were a parameter to set the time length of the charts.  Or additional lines overlaid on the chart with longer periods, like the chart shows the last minute and there's a curve or line that covers trends/samples for the last 15 minutes or some such span of time.  Just an idea.\n\nThere's a second issue I've found.  If the memory graph goes above 1 gigabyte, it does not switch units to gigabytes but just keeps using megabytes.  We have one machine with 20GB of space used.  The issue is that since the charts are currently fixed size, the larger the axis numbers get, the less space there is for the chart itself.  It would be nice if the units switched over to GB to give the chart more space.\n\nAnd apologies for confusion with Jedis.\n"

So if you have any feedback on the part, feel free to let me know.\n\nSo anyway, looks like we have three options:\n1. Another CLI flag\n   1. We're current packing stuff into a single `--es` flag, adding another doesn't really feel nice\n   2. Short-sighted if we're going to have to add more of such flags\n2. Environment variable (e.g. `ES_CA_PATH`)\n   1. Easier to implement, and to extend in the future\n   2. It's the first env var ever used, so it's inconsistent\n3. External config file\n   1. The ultimate solution\n   2. Most likely overkill\n"

Passing `:password` property has a side-effect of Redis with no password setup complaining if password is provided, so it kind of breaks backward compatibility but I think it's fine.\n\nUsing `:` as the delimiter requires that we specify the port even when we use the default port, so I'm going to change the format to `HOST[:PORT][/PASS]`. I'll also remove some code that is no longer necessary with the use of `:password` property.\n"

Thus, for example, the URLs picture1.jpg and ./picture1.jpg have identical \r\nmeaning: they resolve to the same absolute URL.\r\n```\r\n**ad 2**\r\nhttp://stackoverflow.com/questions/9221872/link-practice-without-in-the-beginning-of-href\r\n\r\n``<a class=\"brand\" href=\"/\">redis-stat</a>`` -> ``<a class=\"brand\" href=\"./\">redis-stat</a>``\r\n```\r\nIt is not good practise to use subpage-1 urls exactly because of redirections you might \r\nimplement later on. If you insist on working in a folder, you can use ./subpage-1 and \r\n./ for the home link.\r\n```\r\nI have tested it and it works. When you proxy to access redis-stat from a subfolder, the href link resolved must be the complete url like ``domain/redis-status``. \r\nWithout ``./`` you end up in ``domain`` (without redis-status subfolder in the URI) which is a different location."
