Emojify is opting to do it up front by including all that data in css files. The alternative is to only pull down the ones you need. If the concern is total load time for the page or the app, only pulling the images you need when you need them should be quite a bit faster than what amounts to downloading all of the images for a given category to potentially only show one of them. \n\nEven if you selectively load the stylesheets by category the \"symbols\" file alone is ~1mb. \n\nThe problem is, if I have one match in the symbols set I have to download 1mb of data to show a 3.5k image.\n\nIf you serve those image files with proper cache headers the next time you load that page, your browser won't even download the data at all and it would instantly show that image.\n\nIf you really don't want to see even a \"blink\" the very first time you could even go as far as pre-loading the matched images before you replaced the text.\n\nAs another optimization, rather than putting all the text in the page through 600 regexes it's more efficient to do just one to look for stuff that matches the \"colon something colon\" pattern and _then_ matching only the matched texts against a list of available emojis.\n\nThe total unminified size of https://github.com/henrikjoreteg/emoji-images.js is 13kb plus whatever image data for each matched emoji (each of which should only be served once, then pulled from cache). Just including all the regexes and their string match puts emojify.js at 36k minified just for the JS, that's without the CSS with all the image data.\n\nI completely agree that having them as data-uris is nice and avoiding doing an HTTP GET for each unique image is a nice thought. I totally get why you went this route, but I personally don't think the trade-offs are worth it. \n\nI hope I'm not coming across as rude, that's not my goal at all. I'm just explaining why I didn't use this for our app and opted for another solution.\n"

Once we've got the tests in, perhaps we should hook this library up to [Testling](http://ci.testling.com/) to test in multiple browsers?\n\n(As a minor side-node, personally I prefer Javascript tests as the library itself is Javascript not Coffeescript, but thats just my two cents!)  \n"

I had a lot of issues with weirdness where things like `:'P` would not work because `'` was HTML escaped to `&apost;` and the like, so mine contained a few hacks\n\nI mainly added the string handling code because I was concerned about performance > string > node > insert into DOM > modify & re-insert into DOM\n\nPerhaps I might look at trying to emojify the node representation before the initial insert, perhaps my string motivation was a bit of an early optimization\n"

While I personally appreciate the advantages that spriting brings, I think that's best left to the actual web developers themselves. \n\nSome people might only want a handful of emojis, and would rather not download the whole sprite. I remember a few issues people opened saying they didn't want to download a CSS file full of data-URI images. I thought I'd made it pretty easy with the LESS file, but some didn't agree.\n\nWhat **can** be done, however, is using the emoji name as a class name. You would create your spritesheet, and it would automatically add `emoji <emoji name>` to the class attribute of the tag. It's a fairly simple change, maybe @suprememoocow could share his views?\n"

It specifically allows emoticons at line ends, even when there is no whitespace in front of that emoticon.\n\nBecause there is code in emojify.js specifically handling this case, I assumed it is an important use case for you. That's why I though I'd better add an option to allow emoticons at line ends (even if there is no whitespace in front of the emoticon). So that I can turn this option off.\n\nIf you think we can handle this in a different way (or just rename the option, so that it makes more sense for you), I'm happy with that.\n"

The learning curve for setup+code was pretty much nil.\n\nI am now working on a SPA that can only fetch assets on initial load, after that it shouldn't be making network requests. How would like to see a PR to implement this?\n\nWould you be ok with me having the update.sh process have two flows?\n\nOne would create the array of strings (as you have right now) and maybe the other one could create emoji+base64 encoded png? I know the payload will be very large, but I am fitting into pre-existing requirements.\n\nIf you have a better idea I would love to hear it! I will wait a day or two before I start so other people can provide input. thanks!\n"

Even if the swig mailer one fixed it, then swig itself doesn't support Windows properly IMO. \n\nI think it comes down to this, any plugin that puts HTML on a page should allow users some control over those HTML elements. Usually it's done with callback hooks or something like that. I've needed to do it with almost every library I've used which injected HTML, for example: validators that inject validation messages, datepickers, etc. Sure my use case is for a `style` attribute, but another person might need a class, another a data attribute, etc. I don't see any good reason not to be support it. \n\nAs of right now, after the replacing, I use regex to grab the image's with the `emoji` class and stick on the `style` attribute but that isn't nice at all.\n"

They let you provide a custom renderer which contains optional functions that are called for each type of element. You're given the text (and other relevant arguments) and return a string of the html that will be output.\n\n``` javascript\nrenderer = function (emojiName, imagePath) {\n    return '<img src=\"' + imagePath + '\" alt=\"' + emojiName + '\" data-whatever=\"something\"/>'\n}\n```\n"

As @4ver said, \"I'd expect to be passed all of the variables needed to reproduce what the default replacer returns.\" That is just common practice. I feel like a lot of people would be confused using this library, things aren't obvious / as expected / like other libraries. \n\n---\n\nThe readme could still be better I think. It would help a lot in this respect.\n\n> Now type in an emoji keyword in your HTML, for example :smile: Now run emojify using emojify.run(). To exclude tags from being emojified, add no-emojify to their class attributes.\n> \n> You can optionally pass an object to emojify.run() to restrict the emojification to that object only: emojify.run(document.getElementById('my-element'))\n> \n> You can also use emojify.replace() method to emojify a string directly\n\nDocumenting methods in this way means someone has to read through big blocks of text to see what they need to do / use. Why not have a sections (with their own big headings) for:\n- How to add it to your project; script tag, bower, node\n- .setConfig\n- .run\n- .replace\n- Full usage example\n\nIt's important to clearly document each method's parameters and return values. What some projects do is generate some of their readme from code comments. I also think it's very important that the readme and gh-pages are very consistent; then if you change one, you should update the other too. Or, really simplify one (let's say gh-pages) to a small description (maybe with a live textarea example) and then link to the \"documentation\" (the readme).\n\n(Plus, clearly label what works on Node and what doesn't)\n"

By separating out the emoji parser from the part that replaces/inserts the image tag, we can test the individual parts and have something a lot less buggy. Its kind of like separating out the parts of a compiler.\n\nYoure right about `emojify.replace`, I should probably switch to constructing the html with strings rather than depending on `document.createElement`. We could also reuse `emojify.replace` internally as long as we only use it on nodes where the type is [TEXT_NODE](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Node.nodeType), that way we can guarantee that there will be no html in the string that we are calling `emojify.replace` with.\n"

The blog post is tricky as you would have to parse html without a dom.\n\nThe use cases ive seen for the browser are pretty similar, except that you have a dom for html parsing _but_ you need to keep the size of the library small.\n\nThe \"emojfy a string\" use case is simple to solve for both node and browser, but the \"blog post\" use case (which requires html parsing) is difficult. We have to 1) have a dom parser for node and 2) keep the library small for browsers.\n\nI think that the easiest way for us to support both, is to **not** include jsdom / cheerio / jquery as a dependency, and instead have clear instructions showing that you have to pass in a DomElement, and for node that means that the user has to use something like jsdom to create a DomElement. We have to use a DomElement for the browser anyway because of the points you mentioned (not destroying existing bound events etc).\n"

We need versions to be published to npm. \n\nAlso, we want [Emoji One](http://emojione.com/) support so we think we'd have that done and released faster if we maintained our own project.\n"

        "body": "Ok, let's talk about this. I think another emoji set should be supported by way of another module. A different module for each set.\n\nThis way, each module is as lightweight as possible, has its own single bower.json, package.json, etc. to maintain. So if someone was to download it via bower for example, they'd only get the files needed for that set, the bower.json's `main` property would only point to the images for that set, and so on.\n\nWe could make an \"emojify-core\" module containing the main logic. All of these set-specific modules could then depend on this module and contain only set-specific code on top. \n\nBrowser builds could then be made with browserify / webpack (to mash everything into a single JS file). We might even be able to stick the build stuff into a common `emojify-core-dev` module to be shared.\n\nI personally want exactly everything that's there right now, but the result we'd get is emoji-one's emoji displayed on the screen.\n"
