Ideally the cdn task would have options for `cloudfiles` and `aws_s3` respectively.\n\nHope this comes across as constructive.\n"

        "body": "Right. Normally I wouldn't do something like this, but there are simply way too many emails in this projects to have them all dumped in a single folder. Approx 50 different templates or so right now.\n\nI have however resolved the problem, after consulting the `grunt-assemble` repo I see that this is very simple:\n\n``` js\nmodule.exports = {\n    options: {\n      layoutdir: '<%= paths.src %>/layouts',\n      partials: ['<%= paths.src %>/partials/**/*.hbs'],\n      helpers: ['<%= paths.src %>/helpers/**/*.js'],\n      data: ['<%= paths.src %>/data/*.{json,yml}'],\n      flatten: true\n    },\n    front: {\n      src: ['<%= paths.src %>/emails/front/*.hbs'],\n      dest: '<%= paths.dist %>/front/'\n    },\n    back: {\n      src: ['<%= paths.src %>/emails/back/*.hbs'],\n      dest: '<%= paths.dist %>/back/'\n    }\n};\n```\n\nThanks for your help :)\n"

I think all the syntax I'd want to use is the same between HBS and Mustachio.\r\n\r\nMy ideal scenario is to build the template with g-e-w with dummy data provided from a /data file, iterate over it fully rendered, then be able to flag a render to output in \"template mode,\" with no dummy data and all the partials flattened.\r\n\r\nIn this scenario, littering my template w/ extra flags would be sub-par.\r\n\r\nI'll see if I can pull it off with a helper, but any feasibility insight would be super.

Look forward to your feedback.\r\n\r\n**caveat** php is in there, but it's broken. There's some awkwardness passing variables into the previewer."

One concern I have though is it might add some confusion to noobs. Cloning this repo and running grunt for the first time usually involves a bit of a learning curve (at least for most email developers I've tested it with). If the ejs/hbs/liquid/php files are in there too (in both `dist` and `src`) it adds to that learning curve. Don't have a preferred solution but wondering if this is something that is turned off by default, or maybe they're in another examples folder, something to help them not being an additional distraction.\r\n* Another thought that comes to mind after playing with this is how do I have just one `src` file that integrates with the other features/commands e.g. I would love to have one email source file that I develop and preview locally, send to Mailgun, send to Litmus, and then send off to my 3rd party service.\r\n* Noticed the PHP issue. It's been a while since I wrote PHP so not sure how to fix off hand. Sidenote: What apps/ESPs are you guys using to send email that use PHP?\r\n\r\n"

That will help keep the README smaller, and we can include code samples as opposed to including them in the core repo.\r\n\r\n2. Maybe I'm not understanding correctly. Are you saying there's no way to send the `dist/_sample.liquid` for example via mailgun or to litmus fully rendered with the sample data? If I'm tracking... you're correct that doesn't work, but it could. `dist/_sample.liquid` is what you'd send off to your 3rd party service, right?\r\n\r\n3. PHP - not sure how to fix that either at the moment, nor do I care to spend more time trying to figure it out. I don't personally use many apps, or know of any ESP's that are php-driven. Someone else in the community with a hankering for that could patch and PR..."

Using your git example each time I run grunt send --template=*.html I am sent the last .html file in the folder (transaction.html) three times rather than each email once."
