In order for most of the Quil API (the fns marked as :requires-bindings true in the metadata) to work, they must be executed from the sketch thread. This just means that you need to add your fns as one of the sketch callbacks (setup, draw, etc) or for them to be called from one of those fns.\n\nDoes this make sense?\n"

        "body": "Hey Phil,\n\nlooks like a great start. One thing to consider is how this would work with the current state functionality. Perhaps it might make sense to keep it different? It's worth thinking about.\n\nCurrently, you can set the state with `'set-state!` (which may only be called once to stop it being used as a mutator). This is typically done in the sketch's `:setup` fn:\n\n`(set-state! :foo 1 :bar (atom true))`\n\n Once the state has been state, may then be retrieved by calling `state` and passing the keyword of the state val you'd like to read. i.e. to get the atom associated with the key bar you'd do:\n\n`(state :bar)`\n\nThis would typically be used in the `:draw` fn.\n\nThis means, if you want mutating stuff, you need to store them in refs thus preserving Clojure's nice identity mutation semantics.\n\nWith your approach, you probably wouldn't store stuff in refs, rather you'd just keep replacing vals in a similar way to using `loop`. I therefore wonder whether we need to explicitly store anything with this approach - i.e. it's orthogonal to the 'state' stuff.\n\nInterested in your thoughts...\n"

I had the nagging feeling I was missing something re: state.\n\nThe approach of working with individual fields and hiding the overall map strikes me as odd; was that something intentional or just something quil inherited from clj-processing? It seems like the current `set-state!` defn and friends don't get you much over just a top-level atom def in your sketch namespace. But I understand needing to not introduce breaking changes, so I can switch to making `:update` use its own independent atom.\n\n> With your approach, you probably wouldn't store stuff in refs, rather you'd just keep replacing vals in a similar way to using loop\n\nI think of it as being more like reduce since it's the return value that's used. Anyway, the only reason it's accepted as an argument to `applet` is so that an initial value can be specified; the change always comes from the `:update` function. Maybe `:init` would be a better name for that?\n"

My only concern at this stage is to try and not get the two state handling options confused. It's not clear to me which is going to be the most elegant solution and I think it's great to experiment.

        "body": "@samaaron: Most functions for `PGraphics` are the same as for `PApplet` so they can be used. How about adding something like `with-graphics` macro that takes graphics and forms:\n\n``` clojure\n(with-graphics gr\n  (background 255)\n  (line 0 0 10 10)\n  (rect 25 25 5 5))\n```\n\nAnd create `ThreadLocal` variable for current graphics, this macro first sets it and at the end sets null. And all drawing methods check this thread local var first and if it's null they take current-applet and draw on it.\n"

        "body": "quil+clojure works well because Clojure is a briliant name, a unique namespace. It's a pleasure learning Clojure partly because everything on the web related to Clojure is in one nice little package, regardless of where or how you search for it. Also, I wouldn't expect all Processing related material to contain Java, same goes for Clojure and Quil.\n\nProce55ing was renamed to Processing. ???\nclj-processing was renamed to Quil. ???\n\nProcessing and Quil are TERRIBLE names. They are 'all talk', practically useless as tags, search queries, etc. The whole philosophy of Processing is to make it easier for non-programmers to learn programming. Having your ability to look for answers hindered thus forcing duplicate questions on the subject is not helpful to anybody. \n\nType Clojure, Quil, and Processing into Twitter search. Feel the difference? This is why Rich Hickey is a genius on many levels, and those who renamed Proce55ing and clj-processing are not geniuses on at least one level where Rich Hickey is a genius.\n\nSo yes, I am proposing a name change. Not just a name change, but perhaps a design of guidelines that will assure that something like Processing and Quil never happen again.\n"

And app is crashes.We can try replace thread locals with dynamic vars and keep state and other stuff inside applet. Every call to listeners will be placed inside [binding](http://clojuredocs.org/clojure_core/clojure.core/binding#example_770) where we bind current state, applet. What do you think?\n"

        "body": "Hi\nI've investigated this issue a bit and got following results: it's processing's issue, not quil's. For some reason in `fill` method is always expects color in ARGB format so if you want opaque color you have to set highest bits to FF: `0xFF0000FF` instead of `0x0000FF` (blue color). So if it were java adding explicit alpha part to color would be sufficient.\n\nBut we are using clojure here :\\\n\nThe problem is following - value `0xFF0000FF` is different in java and clojure:  \njava: `0xFF0000FF` = -16776961 (int)\nclojure: `0xFF0000FF` = 4278190335 (long)\n\nQuil tries to convert all values passed to `fill` method to int using `int` function. But clojure's `int` function doesn't allow overflows, so it throws exception if value is greater than max int (it's our case).\n\nI found following ugly workaround: you can convert `0xFF0000FF` to int using `.intValue` method of `Long`:\n\n``` clojure\n(fill (.intValue 0xFF0000FF))\n```\n"

The start and stop parameters specify the\n  angles at which to draw the arc.\"\n  ([x y width height start stop]\n  (.arc (current-applet) (float x) (float y) (float width) (float height)\n        (float start) (float stop)))\n  ([x y width height start stop mode]\n     (let [arc-mode (resolve-constant-key mode arc-modes)])\n  (.arc (current-applet) (float x) (float y) (float width) (float height)\n        (float start) (float stop) (int arc-mode))))\n```\n\n...but `arc-modes` fails on CHORD and PIE:\n\n> CompilerException java.lang.RuntimeException: Unable to find static field: CHORD in interface processing.core.PConstants, compiling:(NO_SOURCE_PATH:1) \n\nIt appears that [CHORD and PIE were added in version 2.0b7](https://github.com/processing/processing/issues/1577) and would therefore not be available in Processing v1.5.1, which Quil currently uses. \n"

There must be an automated way to do this right?\n\n**Go to your   `.m2/repository/group/library/version/`   folder**\n1. `md5sum lib.jar > lib.jar.md5`\n2. `sha1sum lib.jar > lib.jar.sha1`\n3. Change the groupId in lib.pom from\n\n``` xml\n<groupId>libgroup</groupId>\n```\n\nto\n\n``` xml\n<groupId>org.clojars.username.libgroup</groupId>\n```\n1. Add missing sections in lib.pom _by hand_ otherwise clojars complains:\n\n``` xml\n    <description>processing-libs</description>\n    <url>http://www.processing.org</url>\n    <scm>\n        <tag>something relevant?</tag>\n        <url>somewhere relevant?</url>\n    </scm>\n    <licenses>\n        <license>\n            <name/>\n            <url/>\n            <distribution/>\n        </license>\n    </licenses>\n    <developers>\n        <developer>\n            <id/>\n            <name/>\n            <email/>\n        </developer>\n    </developers>\n    <repositories>\n        <repository>\n            <id>clojars.org</id>\n            <url>http://clojars.org/repo/</url>\n        </repository>\n    </repositories>\n```\n1. `md5sum lib.pom > lib.pom.md5`\n2. `sha1sum lib.pom > lib.pom.sha1`\n3. `scp lib* clojars@clojars.org:`\n\nHere they are in github (the md5 and sha1 files not included of course):\nhttps://github.com/originalsurfmex/originalsurfmex_m2/tree/master/repository/processing/core/2.1\nhttps://github.com/originalsurfmex/originalsurfmex_m2/tree/master/repository/processing/gluegen-rt/2.1\n\nHere they are in clojars:\nhttps://clojars.org/org.clojars.originalsurfmex.processing/core\nhttps://clojars.org/org.clojars.originalsurfmex.processing/gluegen-rt\n\nBefore I go ahead and add all of these libs I have two concerns:\n1.

All my jars and pom's are ending up usigned.  I could not figure out how to make them appear as signed while using the `scp` command to push to clojars.  Turns out I did not have to make my own md5 and sha1 hashes. `scp` creates all the for you as outlined in the SSH method here: https://github.com/ato/clojars-web/wiki/Pushing\n\nI already have SSH and PGP keys saved on Clojars.org and my PGP keys are on MIT's keyserver.  I can't see any reason for them to go out unsigned.\n\nIf anybody figures out how to sign them, feel free to comment, they are still in my repo:\nhttps://github.com/originalsurfmex/originalsurfmex_m2/tree/master/repository/processing/\n"

        "body": "As for dependencies: I think you can use jogl and gluegen-rt libraries from their official  repository. This will help you to avoid push manually all jogl and gluegen-rt jars to clojars. How would I do it:\n1. Look which version of jogl and gluegen-rt you need to import:  \n   a. Choose processing version. For example we want to use 2.1.1.  \n   b. Go to http://github.com/processing/processing and go to appropriate tag (press on \"branch: master\" and select tag). For 2.1.1 it would be: https://github.com/processing/processing/tree/processing-0224-2.1.1/  \n   c. Go to `core/library`, download `gluegen-rt.jar` and `jogl.jar` and open them (jars are just zip archives so you rename and open them as zip).  \n   d. Open `META-INF/MANIFEST.MF` and check version. In our example it is: 2.1.4-rc-20140113 for both gluegen-rt and jogl.\n2.  Import jogl and gluegen in your `project.clj`.  \n   a. Add jogamp repository: `:repositories [[\"jogamp\" \"http://www.jogamp.org/deployment/maven/\"]]`  \n   b. Add jogl-main and gluegen-rt-main to dependencies: \n\n``` clojure\n:dependencies [...\n               [org.jogamp.jogl/jogl-all-main \"2.1.4-rc-20140113\"]\n               [org.jogamp.gluegen/gluegen-rt-main \"2.1.4-rc-20140113\"]]\n```\n\nAfter that it hopefully should work and you won't need to upload all gluegen and jogl jars.\nOfficial [jogamp maven instructions](http://jogamp.org/wiki/index.php/Maven) .\n"

I hope jar available on maven has same version which is used by Processing.\n3. The only thing left is `video.jar`.

But you can browse through processing github repo, specifically check version 1.5.1 (the one that was used for quil 1.7.0): https://github.com/processing/processing/tree/processing-1.5.1\nBe aware though that sources for 1.5.1 on github may be slightly different from the ones that were used to compile jar. But in most cases they should be the same.\n\nDo you have any other questions?\nPlease close the issue once they are resolved. \n"

And you cannot really pass macros as first class function.\n\nJust 2 cents... Thanks for the work on Quil!\n"

        "body": "@ysmolsky \n`defsketch` - yes, it is pretty dumb macro that just calls `defapplet`. But I think it was done it order to call \"private\" macro `defapplet` which is defined in another namespace `quil.applet` which is not exposed in documentation.\n\n`defapplet` - is not useless. It does one pretty important thing - it wraps all functions passed in it to var. It allows to do interactive development which is pretty cool. Consider following example:\n\n``` clojure\n(defn draw []\n  (ellipse 50 50 100 100))\n\n(defsketch my-sketch\n  :size [500 500]\n  :draw draw))\n```\n\nIf I start sketch, then change `draw` to draw `(rect 0 0 100 100)` and finally recompile `draw` function without closing sketch - it will immediately use updated version of `draw`. The same effect can be achieved and without macros using following trick:\n\n``` clojure\n(sketch \n  :size [500 500]\n  :draw #'draw))\n```\n\nBut it is not very user-friendly and we requires long explanation which might be difficult for newcomers in clojure. \n\nPersonally I would recommend using `defsketch` while interactive development and switch to `sketch` function when \"exporting\" your work.\n\nIf you have proposals how we can improve these macros - I would be happy to discuss. \n"

        "body": "Hi\n\nI believe it how live mode works in lightable. It reevaluates the whole tab on each change, that is why  new sketch starts on each change. So it is not quil bug but rather incompatibility of `defsketch` and live mode. There are few ways to fix it:\n\n1 - You can disable `defsketch` after you launched first window by adding `#_` before `defsketch`:\n\n``` clojure\n#_(desketch bla-bla\n  :title \"Bla-bla\"\n  :draw draw\n  :size [100 200])\n```\n\nWhen you need to restart sketch - you close existing, remove `#_`, new sketch launches and then you add `#_` back.\n\n2 - You can change workflow to not use live mode. That is actually how I prefer to work. Initially I open tab and evaluate everything using `Ctrl+Shift+Enter` hotkeys. It launches new sketch. When I need to modify some part of code, e.g. `draw` function, I modify it and reevaluate only it by `Ctrl+Enter` hotkeys.\n\nHope this helps.\n"

        "body": "That should solve it. Thanks!\nOn Apr 23, 2014 11:02 AM, \"Nikita Beloglazov\" notifications@github.com\nwrote:\n\n> Hi\n> \n> I believe it how live mode works in lightable. It reevaluates the whole\n> tab on each change, that is why new sketch starts on each change. So it is\n> not quil bug but rather incompatibility of defsketch and live mode. There\n> are few ways to fix it:\n> 1. You can disable defsketch after you launched first window by adding\n>    #_ before defsketch:\n> \n> #_(desketch bla-bla\n>   :title \"Bla-bla\"\n>   :draw draw\n>   :size [100 200])\n> \n> When you need to restart sketch - you close existing, remove #_, new\n> sketch launches and then you add #_ back.\n> 1. You can change workflow to not use live mode. That is actually how\n>    I prefer to work. Initially I open tab and evaluate everything using\n>    Ctrl+Shift+Enter hotkeys. It launches new sketch. When I need to\n>    modify some part of code, e.g. draw function, I modify it and\n>    reevaluate only it by Ctrl+Enter hotkeys.\n> \n> Hope this helps.\n> \n> \u2014\n> Reply to this email directly or view it on GitHubhttps://github.com/quil/quil/issues/92#issuecomment-41139164\n> .\n"

We still should test it under 1.6.0 though. I can't think of nice way to do it because we need to test quil compiled by clojure 1.5.1 but in a project that uses 1.6.0. It would be nice if we could somehow set up `project.clj` to allow us to do it. \nAny ideas welcome.\n"

        "body": "I believe the reason why we see the lag is that point is drawn inside `draw` function which is invoked repeatedly independent from `mouse-moved` callback. For example.\n1. On millisecond X `mouse-moved` was called and new x and y were saved in atom.\n2. On millisecond X+100 `draw` was invoked, which drew the point in old x and y position. In the same time you already moved mouse cursor away from the old point. \n\nThe same behaviour you can see in Processing itself:\n\n``` java\nint x;\nint y;\n\nvoid setup() {\n  size(200, 200);\n  smooth();\n}\n\nvoid draw() {\n  background(125);\n  strokeWeight(20);\n  stroke(10);\n  point(x, y);\n}\n\nvoid mouseMoved() {\n  x = mouseX;\n  y = mouseY;\n}\n```\n\nAs for how to solve it - you can draw point inside `mouse-moved` itself. This will make the lag much less noticeable. \n"

I _do_ also have JDK 1.8 installed but was positive that I was using JDK 1.7 at the time I wrote. Indeed, I no longer have to specify the :jvm-opts option for any version of quil >= 2.0 and everything works fine, no hanging no stack traces. \n\nI am sorry to have bothered you with this; I think you can safely close this issue.\n"

        "body": "> We don't need to expose packing/unpacking to the user.\n\nBut we must if we want to save the clj Quil behevior. Because in JS color stored in  4 integers variables in `imageData` buffer. Look at this code (https://github.com/processing-js/processing-js/blob/master/processing.js#L19136):\n\n``` JavaScript\n      setPixel: function(i,c) {\n        var offset = i*4, data = p.imageData.data;\n        data[offset+0] = (c & 0x00ff0000) >>> 16; // RED_MASK\n        data[offset+1] = (c & 0x0000ff00) >>> 8;  // GREEN_MASK\n        data[offset+2] = (c & 0x000000ff);        // BLUE_MASK\n        data[offset+3] = (c & 0xff000000) >>> 24; // ALPHA_MASK\n      },\n```\n\nAnd this apporach used in all `set` and `setPixel` functions in Processing.js. If user want to working directly with `imageData` buffer then they must pack\\unpack values.\n\nThis is different with Processing. Processing use one `int` variable per pixel. You can see it (for example) this: https://github.com/processing/processing/blob/master/core/src/processing/core/PGraphicsJava2D.java#L2607\n"

You should call it in `draw` instead. Example:\n\n``` clojure\n(defn draw\n  (q/background 255)\n  ; all other drawings here\n  )\n```\n\nAs side-note, you may want to check [functional mode](https://github.com/quil/quil/wiki/Functional-mode-%28fun-mode%29) middleware. It helps you to handle the state of the sketch. \n"

        "body": "Hi Stuart.\n`map` returns a lazy sequence so invocations of `q/ellipse` are not evaluated until you request it explicitly. In your case you're just calling `map` and not using result. `map` is used when you need to transform some collection and get new collection as the result. In you case you want to perform perform side-effect operations. For that you should use [`doseq`](http://clojuredocs.org/clojure_core/clojure.core/doseq):\n\n``` clojure\n(doseq [point state]\n  (q/ellipse (:x point) (:y point) 10 10))\n```\n\n Alternatively you can force the result of `map` to be evaluated by using [`dorun`:](http://clojuredocs.org/search?x=0&y=0&q=dorun&lib=clojure_core)\n\n``` clojure\n(dorun (map #(q/ellipse (:x %1) (:y %1) 10 10) state))\n```\n\nBut I prefer `doseq` as it more explicitly shows that I'm doing some side-effecting here.\n\nIt is quite common confusion when dealing with `map`, so you should be aware of it. Consider this artificial example:\n\n``` clojure\n(defn load-users [ids]\n  (with-open-database [db (get-db)]\n    (map #(load db %) ids)))\n```\n\nThis function does following:\n1. Open database.\n2. Creates lazy seq containing specified users.\n3. Closes databases.\n4. Returns the sequence.\n   But the problem is that users are not loaded as you get lazy sequence. When you try to get first element of the sequence, `(load db some-id)` is be invoked but the database has been already closed and you get an exception. So here you have to force evaluation of all elements in the sequence using [`doall`](http://clojuredocs.org/clojure_core/clojure.core/doall): \n\n``` clojure\n(doall (map #(load db %) ids))\n```\n\nRule of thumb for me when I get weird exceptions is to try to force evaluate all sequences and see if it works.\n\nHope this helps. If it solved your problem - please close the issue.\n\nThanks,\nNikita \n"

For calling quil functions outside the sketch you must wrap it to `with-sketch` macro:\n\n```\n(q/with-sketch (q/get-sketch-by-id id)\n    *call drawing functions*)\n```\n\nwhere `id` is id of sketch canvas element. \n\nSo, you can run sketch once and stop it when animation is ended or when extern timer call `quil.core/no-loop` for sketch.\n\nAbout reloading canvas and sketch.\n\nIf you don't replace sketch on canvas you can use `no-loop` and `start` functions for it. With external function for state updating of course.\n\nSo, If you whant to replace sketch on Canvas I recommended using only `:P2D` or only `:P3D` on one canvas. In this case you must call `quil.core/exit` in old sketch and bind a new sketch to canvas.\n\nM.b. useful: \nhttps://github.com/quil/quil/wiki/List-of-available-functions-in-ClojureScript\nhttps://github.com/quil/quil/wiki/ClojureScript#with-sketch-macro\n"

I tried some of the jogl examples, and at least the simple examples work fine (shadowmapping and HDR examples didn't work, both with DRI_PRIME set and unset). The funny thing is that the app window sometimes (most of the times actually, couldn't reproduce it not drawing just now) displays correctly, even with my test triangles in it, but can't be closed properly. I believe the crash doesn't even occur if I let it keep running.\nSummarizing, it is like parachuting without a chute atm: it works, but only once :grin: \n"

It would be cool too if you tried running p3d sketch in Processing itself: http://processing.org/ It should be pretty simple, just download and run. I believe they even include samples so you don't need to write your own sketch.\n\nCould you also try running the sketch via `lein run`? You might get more information as in cider messages are printed in different buffers and it is easy to miss something. \n"

Install full version of JRE that includes graphics components.\n2. Use Quil on ClojureScript - it doesn't require graphics stuff from JRE because it only compiles cljs code to js. And then you run the sketch from a browser.\n\nI would recommend 1 because regular quil supports live reloading and generally it is easier to work with it.  \n"

If so, I don't think it is possible to achieve with Quil/Processing, as it seems quite low-level and very OS-specific. \n\nOn the other hand if you want to create a sketch where user can draw (and you implement draw logic like mouse handlers and so on) then you definitely can read this display data. \n"

For some reason I thought this only worked with images after my first read earlier today.\n\nThank you for your time!\n"

        "body": "Hi Timur\n\nQuil provides only primitives for drawing figures, it doesn't provide any modeling elements, you have to implement them yourselves. I usually represent elements as simple maps and implement functions that take this maps and draw object using Quil functions. This also allows easily extend my elements with additional data as they're simple maps and I can freely add new fields. \nIf you want, you can provide your current code and I could try to help adding dragability to it.\n\nNikita\n"

If you want to embed it into Quil sketch you can then simply render result png file using [load-image](http://quil.info/api/image/loading-and-displaying#load-image)/[image](http://quil.info/api/image/loading-and-displaying#image) combination. JLatexMath is present in maven so it is easy to include into leiningen project.\n\nNikita\n"

        "body": "Quil provides 2 modes: \n1. Regular one, when you handle state changes by your own. In that mode `draw` function doesn't take any arguments and there is no `update` function.\n2. fun-mode, which is [functional mode](https://github.com/quil/quil/wiki/Functional-mode-%28fun-mode%29). It is enabled by adding `fun-mod` middleware to list of middlewares when you create a sketch. In that mode `draw` has to take a `state` argument. And also you can provide `update` function which updates the state on each tick.\n\nYou have to be careful and have correct version of `draw` depending on which state you're using. In your case above you're creating 2 sketches at the same time (which is probably wrong, I think you need only the sketch in `-main`). You need to figure it which mode you want to use and then use correct mode in the sketch inside `-main`.\n\nI think documentation is correct. Confusion comes from the fact that `lein new quil bla` generates a new quil project with default sketch which uses `fun-mode`, while \"runnable jar\" tutorial uses regular mode. \n"

Because if you check https://github.com/processing-js/processing-js/blob/master/src/Processing.js (be careful! a lot of code!) for `Drawing3D.prototype.size` you can't find something different than\n\n```\nfunction getGLContext(canvas) {\n          var ctxNames = ['experimental-webgl', 'webgl', 'webkit-3d'],\n              gl;\n\n          for (var i=0, l=ctxNames.length; i<l; i++) {\n            gl = canvas.getContext(ctxNames[i], {antialias: false, preserveDrawingBuffer: true});\n            if (gl) {\n              break;\n            }\n          }\n\n          return gl;\n        }\n```\n\nfor initializing context of canvas element for 3D drawing mode.

        "body": "Hi Andrea\n1. Agree, it is quite confusing that in cider all exception stack doesn't go to repl buffer. Actually it goes to another buffer `*nrepl-server*`. I believe if you switch to that buffer you'll see the stacks. For debugging purposes you can use [pause-on-error](http://quil.info/api/middleware#pause-on-error) middleware. Actually it was inspired by the inkwell library your mentioned. There is an open issue for redirecting stack traces to repl buffer [#115](https://github.com/quil/quil/issues/115), but doing so hurts performance a little bit so I don't want to enable it by default. I'm thinking about adding it to the `pause-on-error` middleware.\n2. Didn't understand the second question. Can you elaborate on the workflow you're thinking about? What should it draw and how do you want to interact with the sketch? \n"

Usually people clear the sketch on each frame and redraw everything. But if you want - you can clear sketch only when needed and each frame will be adding new shapes, thus avoiding needless redrawing. I did it for drawing trees recently: when I drew branches I didn't clear older branches so that at each point of time I had to draw only new branches, which drastically improved performance. \n"

        "body": "Hi Nathan\n\nYes, I believe the best way to draw squiggle is to use `mouse-moved` or `mouse-dragged` events. And \"previous point\" should match current point of last polled location. Here is an example of a sketch that draws connecting line from mouse-dragged event: \nhttp://quil.info/sketches/show/8FoquKaDzP (you can run it from the browser)\n\nAlso if you want to save coordtinates of the squiggle - you can simply have a collection of all points in state and append a new point on each mouse-dragged event. In `draw` function you simply draw squiggle using all points:\nhttp://quil.info/sketches/show/LjeyT85ye8\n\nIn both cases I don't see gaps between lines and everything looks quite smooth. Is it possible that there is a bug in your implementation? Like if you in `mouse-dragged` event you store current and previous points to state and `draw` draws a line between them . What happens if `mouse-dragged` called twice before `draw` is called? \n"

        "body": "Yes, I believe the main reason behind not adding `createShape` is that Quil doesn't have API for working with PShape object. Though you still can access them via java interop:\n\n``` clojure\n(let [shape (.createShape (q/current-graphics))]\n  (doto shape\n    (.beginShape)\n    (.noStroke)     \n    ...))\n```\n\nSo working with shapes is totally possible but in not a very clojury way. Pull requests with adding API (may via new namespace) for working with shapes is welcome! \n\nAs for `vertex`, yes it was designed to work with current-graphics (either applet instance or custom graphics object), but I think you can also use it with shape:\n\n``` clojure\n(q/with-graphics my-shape\n  (q/vertex 1 2 3)\n  ...))\n```\n"

As for actual work, I haven't done anything yet. \n\nAs for estimates I'd say it shouldn't be very hard: I don't think they changed public API much, so most function will stay unchanged. The most fun part will be in quil.applet namespace where we create PApplet and access not so public methods which probably changed. \n\nPersonally I'm planning to do it in following way:\n1. Use Processing 3.0 from pure clojure without quil to create simple empty applet. Just to see if the way to create applets from code has changed. \n2. Update quil `project.clj` to use processing 3 and try to create simple applet from quil. Fix all bugs in quil.applet.\n3. Run tests which exercise all public function in quil.core and fix all broken functions, if any. Check if we need to add new functions.\n4. Check that creating uberjar still works (especially with 3D). \n\nAny help welcome!\n\nI'll keep this bug as main for Processing 3.0 migration.\n"

        "body": "Started today. Progress can be tracked in https://github.com/quil/quil/tree/processing3 branch. Also to have some fun I decided to use this issue and report migration progress here. \n\nSo I started with simple clojure program that uses raw `processing.core.PApplet`. High level API didn't change much. Here is the program: \n\n``` clojure\n(ns proc3.core\n  (:import processing.core.PApplet))\n\n(let [applet (proxy [PApplet] []\n               (settings []\n                 (.size this 200 200))\n               (setup []\n                 (.background this (int 0)))\n               (draw []\n                 (.stroke this 255)\n                 (when (.-mousePressed this)\n                   (.line this\n                          (.-mouseX this) (.-mouseY this)\n                          (.-pmouseX this) (.-pmouseY this))))\n               (exitActual []))]\n\n  (PApplet/runSketch (into-array String [\"Bla\"]) applet))\n```\n\nThe main (only?) difference with processing 2 that `(.size)` method has to be called inside new `PApplet.settngs` method and not from `PApplet.setup`. \n\nAfter that created branch in quil for the migration work. Changed deps to processing 3 and fixed few bugs in `quil.Applet` due to removal `PApplet.resize`. And was able to create a simple sketch from Quil! Used only `(q/ellipse)` so sketch was very simple. Didn't test any handlers or features like :present or :resizable modes. But it looks promising: I didn't expect to get simple sketch working so soon. \n"

        "body": "Tried running all tests (each test exercises some function from quil.core and checks that no errors is thrown, it doesn't check that rendering is correct). Many tests failed. Some due to broken `(width)` and `(height)` function which were easy to fix. Some tests due to internal changes in processing: some functions like `PApplet.copy` can take a `PImage` as source. So some tests create a new graphics, draw on it and then pass it as `PImage` because `PGraphics` externds `PImage`. Unfortunately processing no longer supports. So we have to workaround these tests by not using graphics as PImage.\n\nAlso noticed a bug when you close sketch that uses opengl renderer (which are in the fact p2d, p3d, opengl renderers), then underlying window object doesn't get destroyed and its icon stays in OS' task bar. I found how to destroy it: by getting `GLWindow` object: `PApplet.getSurface().getNative()` and then calling `destroy()` on it. There is a small problem though, if I destroy it immediately on sketch close there is still some delayed task being executed and I get NullPointerException because window was destroyed by the time this task runs. I couldn't find a way to wait until all tasks are done and then destroy window (I'm not that familiar with how jogl library internally works). So I'm thinking about simply waiting for 0.5 sec or so and then destroy window. It's ugly, but hopefully is fine for most usecases and users shouldn't worry much unless they create/close sketches _very_ fast. \n\nUnfortunately my work this weekend wasn't very productive, Fixed width/height, couple of tests and started fixing this destroying-windows things. \n"

Also all tests cannot be run in single run, after a while JOGL throws error. I think it might be due to the fact that JOGL not optimized to create windows many times during single JVM run. And in our tests we have a lot (50+) tests that use JOGL renderers (:p2d or :p3d). As workaround I split all tests in sets of 50 tests in each and run single set at a time: `lein test :set-0`, `lein test :set-1`, etc. 4 sets total. \n"

        "body": "Thanks @GoToLoop. Added support for `:settings` just to support `smooth` and `no-smooth`. Feels ugly and I'm sure will be confusing for users, but couldn't think of a better way to support it. So usage is something like this;\n\n``` clojure\n(q/defsketch my-sketh\n  :settings #(q/smooth 2)\n  :setup setup\n  :draw draw)\n```\n\nUploaded latest version to  https://clojars.org/quil/versions/2.3.0-SNAPSHOT \n"

I think we can simply add a call to generate cheatsheet at the end of that file.\n\nAlso can you add instructions to `cheat_sheet_gen` how to generate pdf from tex? As I understand you first run script to generate tex file and then run latex to generate pdf, right? Also what dvi file is used for? \n"

Apparently some processingJs functions use values constants instead of ints while we expected only ints (like in regular processing).

In fun-mode it would be quite easy - all handlers get event object already so I can simply add some logic that adds few new keys to the events. As for standard, non-fun-mode, I'm not sure what the best way to do it. Meanwhile you can access event using `(.-keyEvent (quil.applet/current-applet))`. \n\n@GoToLoop yes, your approach is good but I think it works only for a set of special symbols such that CTRL+Z which have ASCII equivalent. Alt/shift + key don't have special meaning AFAIK. \n"

        "body": "@jaredly I see. Yes, that's a workaround. Though quil was designed with having \"draw\" function that does draw commands inside it and invoked many times per second. Instead you introduce another approach where nothing is being redrawn and instead you call drawing functions separately and their result is stored and not cleared. But I think at the end, if you want to use quil, you still need to go back to \"everything inside 'draw' function\" approach and this switch maybe confusing because user already got used to \"just call any drawing function anywhere and it results stays\". \n\nAlso cool tutorial! Is it cljs-in-cljs? I tried to set it up for http://quil.info/sketches/create but failed. Currently it uses server-side cljs compilation. How hard is it to add cljs-in-cljs support for quil.info do you think?\n"

Fix compiled processing.js in quil/processing-js. That means I have to remember to fix it every time I upload new version of processing.js\n3. Add `window.l;` to externs.

If it's already in maven somewhere - perfect, just add its coordinates to `project.clj`. Otherwise you might need to download it, upload to local maven repo using [`localrepo`](https://github.com/kumarshantanu/lein-localrepo) plugin. \n2. Familiarize yourself with java interop. As you're going to work with plugin - you have to use create java class and call methods on it. \n3. Translate example from gifAnimation readme to clojure. Check thread I mentioned above as example of similar translation. Basically you need to create instance of `Gif` object in `setup` function passing `quil.applet/current-applet` instead of `this`. \n"

This seems to happen when I have had more than one sketch displayed and am trying to exit the second one (but only sometimes).\n\nSome Googling suggested that other people had similar problems with Processing's `getInstanceById` (which is called by `q/get-sketch-by-id`).\n\nI've worked around it by holding onto the sketch when I create it, so I can do:\n\n``` clojurescript\n(q/with-sketch @saved-sketch-atom\n  (q/exit))\n```\n\nIf you are interested, my new code at and around https://github.com/simon-katz/nomisdraw/blob/5d21f77883ebacfc2a1c4d9d5da19141cce82fd0/src/cljs/nomisdraw/utils/nomis_quil_on_reagent.cljs#L72-L73\n\nSo I'm now only using the public API, which was my goal.\n\nThanks for your help.\n"

        "body": "Hi Harrison. Most quil functions must be executed inside setup/update/draw or handlers because they need to know what \"current sketch\" is. `random` one of such functions: https://github.com/quil/quil/blob/master/src/cljc/quil/core.cljc#L3166 So it is working as intended. Generally quil is not very repl friendly: you cannot just run single quil function like `rect` or `line`. Instead you redefine the whole `draw` function:\n\n``` clojure\ntesting.core=> (defn draw-state [] (q/rect 0 0 100 100))\n; rect is drawn\ntesting.core=> (defn draw-state [] (q/ellipse 0 0 100 100))\n; ellipse is drawn\n```\n"

        "body": "Hi. Sorry for the late reply. I did some debugging and it's indeed impossible to do using only quil API, you'll have to use java interop. So the code will look like this:\n\n``` clojure\n(let [gr (create-graphics spiral-size spiral-size :pdf \"filename.pdf\")]\n  (with-graphics gr (draw-spiral))\n  (.dispose gr))\n```\n\nNote the `(.dispose gr)` call at the end. This call closes pdf writer and flushes all content to file on disk. Actually I think there is a more idiomatic Processing way to do it using `beginRecord()` and `endRecord()` methods, but quil currently doesn't expose them. I'll add `do-record` macro:\n\n``` clojure\n(do-record (create-graphics spiral-size spiral-size :pdf \"filename.pdf\")\n  (draw-spiral))\n```\n"

        "body": "I tried to implement `with-sketch` for clojure but failed. Nothing was drawn on a sketch. I believe Processing doesn't support drawing outside of \"draw\" function. After `draw` is called processing [disposes graphics](https://github.com/processing/processing/blob/master/core%2Fsrc%2Fprocessing%2Fcore%2FPApplet.java#L2430) object and if we try to draw on it from another thread using `with-sketch` nothing will happen. It silently ignores all draw operations. \n\nSome other lifecycle functions like `start-loop` and `no-loop` might still work but it doesn't feel right to support `with-sketch` if only limited number of functions are going to work. I'm closing this issue as \"not feasible\". If anyone has ideas how to fix it - feel free to reopen.  \n"

        "body": "Hi Yehonathan \r\n\r\nHave you looked at https://github.com/quil/quil-site/blob/master/src/cljs/editor/quil_site/compiler.cljs? It does the compilation part. The setup in quil.info is following:\r\n\r\nThere is the main window and iframe where sketch runs. \r\n1. User clicks \"compile\".\r\n2. We take user code and compile it in main window. Output of compilation is string with js code. Note that at this stage we compile only user code, we don't compile any of quil code. \r\n3. Compiled js code sent to the iframe with the sketch using postMessage.\r\n4. Sketch iframe upon receiving postMessage evaluates js code. In the iframe we preload unobfuscated compiled quil + clojurescript core js so upon evaluating user code all quil and core functions are defined.\r\n\r\nWhen we compile user code at step 2, it uses some quil and core macros and compiler has to be aware of them. To achieve that we preload compilation cache for quil and cljs macros namespaces: \r\nhttps://github.com/quil/quil-site/blob/master/src/cljs/editor/quil_site/compiler.cljs#L38\r\nhttps://github.com/quil/quil-site/blob/master/src/cljs/editor/quil_site/compiler.cljs#L45\r\n\r\nCache is built beforehand by running cljs self-host on nodejs: \r\nhttps://github.com/quil/quil-site/blob/master/cache/src/cljs/cache/core.cljs\r\n\r\nSo, to support quil inside klipse I'd suggest doing similar: reuse caches to compile user code to js and evaluate it assuming that main quil library already preloaded.

I believe there might be a real issue here. \r\n\r\n@Norgat, looking at quil implementation of `mouse-pressed?` we just return 'mousePressed' property of Processing object: [link](https://github.com/quil/quil/blob/master/src/cljc/quil/core.cljc#L2610). But according to the issue you referenced we should be using __mousePressed.

I have miss that Processing.js have ```mousePressed``` event and ```mousePressed``` variable in Processing language **(!)**. So you're right - my code checks is not what we need.\r\n\r\nBut now I look at the Processing.js code and find one more potential bug in Quil cljs.\r\nThe list of Processing.js internal variables: https://github.com/processing-js/processing-js/blob/master/processing.js#L9796\r\n\r\n1. ```__mousePressed``` (this discussion)\r\n2. ```__keyPressed``` (missed now is Quil cljs)\r\n3. ```__frameRate``` (currently used: https://github.com/quil/quil/blob/master/src/cljc/quil/core.cljc#L1871)\r\n\r\n\r\nSo, I think we need to change:\r\n\r\n1. https://github.com/quil/quil/blob/master/src/cljc/quil/core.cljc#L2610\r\n2. https://github.com/quil/quil/blob/master/src/cljc/quil/core.cljc#L2220\r\n\r\nfor cljs code like ```current-frame-rate```."

        "body": "Hi Prakhar. \r\n\r\nHaving such function seems reasonable. I wouldn't use `PVector.random3D()` because it returns PVector and clojure has its own vector type. So clojure implementation of such function like you suggest is preferable. Though I'm wondering if there is a way to make it faster. I can imagine such function can be called often and should be optimized. Having multiple iterations like map/reduce/repeatedly might hurt performance. The optimized version won't be as idiomatic but I think it's a fair price to pay. Do you want to make a pull request? "

        "body": "Great! I was thinking the fact that vector has only 3 components. This allows us to generate each component separately as there are few them and not necessary to use iteration functions. We probably even use spherical coordinates to generate it: unit vector is essentially a point on a sphere with radius 1. And cartesian coordinatex x, y and z of point are determined using 2 angles and r: http://mathworld.wolfram.com/SphericalCoordinates.html Formulas 4, 5, 6\r\n\r\nGiven that r is 1. You just need generate 2 random angles and calculate x, y, z: \r\n\r\n```\r\ntheta = rand(0, 2PI)\r\nphi = rand(-Pi/2, Pi2/)\r\nx = cos(theta)*sin(phi)\r\ny = sin(theta)*sin(phi)\r\nz = cos(phi)\r\nanswer = [x, y, z]\r\n```\r\nIt think it should be faster than generating 3 random coordinates and normalizing them. Also It should have more even distribution of random vector (see [this](http://stackoverflow.com/a/6283140/575421) stackoverflow answer)."

In version 2.4.0 I decided that it would be a good idea to change display density from 1 to whatever current screen has: https://github.com/quil/quil/blob/master/src/clj/quil/applet.clj#L204 Probably it wasn't such a good idea after all. I'm still not sure to be honest.\r\n\r\nAnyway, to fix you problem you can set [pixel density](http://quil.info/api/environment#pixel-density) back to 1 in `:settings` function and it'll fix it:\r\n\r\n```clojure\r\nq/defsketch resize\r\n  :title \"You spin my circle right round\"\r\n  :size [220 220]\r\n  :setup setup\r\n  :settings #(q/pixel-density 1)\r\n  :draw draw-state\r\n  :features [:keep-on-top]\r\n  :middleware [m/fun-mode])\r\n```\r\n\r\nI'll keep this bug open until I decide if I should remove auto-detection for pixel dencity. \r\n"

        "body": "Hi Andrew. I suspect the problem is with \"update\" step where you have to calculate new state which involves a lot manipulations and clojure is not particularly effective in these tasks. So you have to explore wonderful world of optimizing clojure code. I suggest you to try using benchmarks libraries like [criterium](https://github.com/hugoduncan/criterium). Measure how long it takes to run `update-state`. \r\n\r\nLooking at your algorithm I think there are some ways to improve it. First of all let's estimate complexity of single update. Let's say you have NxM table. You have N\\*M cells. And to update each cell you need to find all its neighbors. To find each neighbor you're iterating through all cells so looking up neighbor requires N\\*M operations. So total complexity of updating cells is:\r\n\r\nN\\*M (updates) \\* 8 (neighbors) \\* N\\*M (cost of finding neighbor) = 8\\*N^2\\*M^2\r\n\r\nIt's not really possible to optimize the first N*M because you have to recalculate state of each cell on every update. But we can optimize the getNeighbor to run in O(1) instead of O(N*M). For that we need to change the way you store cells. Today you store them as vector, but instead you can store them as map. Instead of:\r\n\r\n```clojure\r\n(def cells [\r\n  {:x 0 :y 0 :alive true} \r\n  {:x 0 :y 1 :alive false} \r\n  {:x 1 :y 0 :alive true}\r\n  {:x 1 :y 1 :alive false}])\r\n```\r\n\r\ntry following structure:\r\n\r\n```clojure\r\n(def cells {\r\n  [0 0] true\r\n  [0 1] false\r\n  [1 0] true\r\n  [1 1] false})\r\n```\r\n\r\nThat way getNeighbor can be written as:\r\n\r\n```clojure\r\n(defn getNeighbor [x y cells]   \r\n  (let [alive? (cells [x y] :none)]\r\n    (if (= alive? :none)\r\n      (rand-nth [true false])\r\n      alive?)))                                                                             \r\n```\r\n\r\nI believe it should drastically improve performance. But try criterium to verify improvements. It is so much fun optimizing code and see execution times go down. "

        "body": "The goal of functional mode is to separate computation part from \"side-effect\" part, which drawing. The process of drawing involves 2 steps that are often intermixed but in functional mode they are separate: the first is **what** to draw (prepare data required for drawing) and the second is **how** to draw (implementing functions that take that data and draw it). Personally it helps me to think about data without being distracted with drawing details. Another benefit of that separation is that `update` should ideally be pure function. Which means you can run it in repl to test and iterate. At the same time you can't run `draw` from repl because it has to be run \"from\" sketch. \r\n\r\nHaving said that if you find it easier to combine them - you might find it easier using Quil without functional mode. Without functional mode you have only `draw` and no explicit state object. But it you need it - you can use either [state-atom](http://quil.info/api/state#state-atom) or even declare you own global atom variable and change it inside `draw`. "

        "body": "It kinda works. In ClojureScript you can't save sketch to a file because it runs in browser and you can't create files from js in browser AFAIK. What q/save or q/save-frame do instead is they conver image into base64 and open a new tab using encoded image as source:  https://github.com/processing-js/processing-js/blob/master/src/Processing.js#L8796\r\n\r\nSo each time you call save/save-frame it opens a new tab. In my case chrome blocks all these new tabs thinking it's spam. There is a small icon in page url bar on the right which says that pop up blocked. If you click you'll see all new tabs for each frame. And when you click on one of them it should open a tab with image of your sketch.\r\n\r\nBut probably it's not what you need anyway. If you want to generate images I think you have to use clojure version. Or do saving yourself somehow using js/server side. "

And the defsketch only shows mouse functions.  So, I was very confused, which is why I posted the issue and the message.  I am getting an error message about \"missing event handlers\" in processing.js.  When I looked at the line that is generating the error I noticed it is in a function designed to handle the \"touch\" events.  I see there where it maps the touch events to mouse handlers.  So, I  updated one of my mouse handlers to draw some text when clicked.  And when I tap on my phone it appears.  So, I think everything is good.\r\nThanks for the quick reply."

But push/pop-style work with styles (like color or stroke weight). For things like rotation/translation/scaling you should use push-matrix and pop-matrix. Or even better you can use [with-rotation](http://quil.info/api/transform/utility-macros#with-rotation) macro. Example:\r\n\r\n```clojure\r\n(let [angle (* q/TWO-PI h)]\r\n  (q/stroke 255 100 150)\r\n  (q/arc 0 0 300 300 0 angle)\r\n  (q/with-rotation [angle]\r\n    (q/line 0 0 60 0)))\r\n\r\n(let [angle (* q/TWO-PI m)]\r\n  (q/stroke 150 100 255)\r\n  (q/arc 0 0 280 280 0 angle)\r\n\r\n  (q/with-rotation [angle]\r\n    (q/line 0 0 70 0)))\r\n\r\n(let [angle (* q/TWO-PI s)]\r\n  (q/stroke 150 255 100)\r\n  (q/arc 0 0 260 260 0 angle)\r\n\r\n  (q/with-rotation [angle]\r\n    (q/line 0 0 128 0)))\r\n```"

        "body": "Thanks, I didn't realize sketchpad.cc is a website :) Ok, so here is what I got. Arc looks great on sketchpad.cc. sketchpad.cc uses processing.js 1.4.8. Quil uses processing.js 1.6.6. Arc got broken between 1.4.8 and 1.6.6. After checking each version I found that it got broken in 1.4.16. There were multiple commits related to `arc` in 1.4.16: [one](https://github.com/processing-js/processing-js/commit/105ec5fbc819fab4c7ce578acc08e45c9604060f), [two](https://github.com/processing-js/processing-js/pull/186). They accidentally (or intentionally?) made arc drawing worse when a thick line is used.\r\n\r\nI'm not going to roll back quil to use processing.js 1.4.8. It would be great if someone fixed arc in processing.js. I know that processing.js in support mode so chances of it being fixed are not high. I might take a shot at some point if I feel adventurous and math-hungry. "

Currently pause-on-error simply [printlns](https://github.com/quil/quil/blob/master/src/clj/quil/middlewares/pause_on_error.clj#L14) error to console in addition to drawing it in sketch. Maybe nrepl provides some functions/namespaces in clojure that allow you to print into emacs' buffer? I haven't looked how to work with nrepl from clojure. "

For now I've settled on a combination of `:features [:no-bind-output]` which prints the error to the repl and `:middlewares [m/pause-on-exception]` which causes the sketch to stop. Unfortunately it seems to not resume sometimes, but that's okay given that i can just re-run `defsketch` and start anew.\r\n\r\nAnother thing that I've noticed is that working with other renderers (`:opengl` or `:p3d`) the error message doesn't get displayed at all? Is that intentional / a known limitation of these renderers?"

The run might be launched from a command-line call (`lein run ...`) rather than from a REPL, and that command-line might also include many other arguments that have to be handled by Clojush's `-main` function. At the end of each generation of the genetic programming process I would like to draw some lines and shapes to a window using Quil functions, showing what's happening in the genetic programming population, but it would not be easy to run the entire system from within a Quil sketch.\r\n\r\n- I would like to augment the `interpret-program` function in my [Propel](https://github.com/lspector/propel) implementation of the Push language to take an `animate?` argument which, when `true`, causes a window to pop up and show an animation of the program being executed, showing all of the data stacks with items being pushed/popped/modified, much like the diagrams that I created by hand in [this presentation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryW9w5cAwaI&t=12s). I would like this to be available wherever `interpret-program` is called, which may be in an as-yet-unknown machine learning system which may not involve a Quil sketch.\r\n\r\n- A student of mine recently wanted to use genetic programming to evolve images, and to present the images to the user for assessment during evolution. This would involve popping up a window, drawing to it, and then accepting user input of some kind. All of this can be handled quite nicely in Quil, but only if the entire system is created within a sketch, which may require that it be re-designed and re-written.\r\n\r\n- A student of mine recently wanted to use genetic programming to evolve images, and wanted to use Quil's image processing functions as part of the automated \"fitness\" assessment process. His system had its own control structure that could not easily be reformulated to run within a Quil sketch, and he was unable to figure out how he could use Quil's functions in any other context.\r\n\r\nMore generally, both for scientific and artistic purposes, I have often found that I (or my students) have a pre-existing control structure that does not naturally fit within the structure of a Quil/Processing draw loop, and I would then like to add functionality that Quil so beautifully provides -- usually just drawing. I then seem to have just two options: 1) Re-think and re-write the whole thing to work within a Quil draw loop, which can often be quite involved, or 2) use some other library, but really there just don't seem to be any other good options, and certainly none with the ease of use and great visual control of Quil/Processing.\r\n"

        "body": "Thanks for the extensive examples! Really useful to better understand that context. I agree that Quil's sketch structure should not dictate the structure of the whole program when sketch is not the main part of the program. And I believe it's possible to use Quil in that way without major changes to the library. \r\n\r\nWhen I think about such cases I mentally split the program into 2 parts: main algorithmic part and visualization (Quil). Naturally it's easier to interleave algorithm and drawing parts of program. For example if I want to implement and visualize Dijkstra algorithm I might implement it like \r\n\r\n1. Find next node.\r\n2. Update its neighbors.\r\n3. Redraw state. \r\n\r\nThis is not easy with Quil as you mentioned, because you can't just \"redraw\" something outside of sketch. So instead I'm using slightly different approach: I treat Quil as a separate subprogram that interacts with the main algorithmic part of the program via some interface. Simplest kind of the interface between Quil and main part would be a mutable object, atom: when the main program runs, it updates the state. Quil sketch is running in parallel and constantly redraws the state. Trivial example of such interaction is progress bar:\r\n\r\n```clojure\r\n(ns progress-bar\r\n  (:require [quil.core :as q]))\r\n\r\n(defn draw-progress [progress]\r\n  (q/background 255)\r\n  ; Drawing progress as text\r\n  (q/text (str \"Done \" progress \"%\") 100 100))\r\n\r\n(defn start-progress-bar [state]\r\n  (q/sketch\r\n    :size [200 200]\r\n    :draw #(draw-progress (:progress @state))))\r\n```\r\n\r\nNow you can call `start-progress-bar` function passing an atom that contains map `{:progress 0}`. Main program changes the progress key to some number and sketch redraws it. \r\n\r\nNaturally state can be more complex than that. For example it might contain data stacks from Push. Similarly you can add feedback capability by passing listeners to the function that creates sketch. For example for the Push animation you might want handle to handle \"space\" key as \"execute next command\":\r\n\r\n```clojure\r\n(defn animate-push-program [state trigger-next-command-fn]\r\n  (q/sketch\r\n    :size [500 500]\r\n    :draw (draw @state)\r\n    :key-pressed #(when (= (q/key-as-keyword) :space)\r\n                    (trigger-next-command-fn))))\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis approach forces you to think about the interface between the main program and animation. Which  is probably annoying when you need to create simple animation but as soon as main program becomes non-trivial you need to think about it anyway. Also it helps to keep animation separate from the main program which is kinda cool and allows to swap animation implementation. Of course assuming that interface is generic enough. \r\n\r\nIn somewhat similar vein few years ago I created a multplayer snake game in clojure. Logic that updates the world runs on server. Clients implemented using quil. When new client connects to the server then the server starts sending world state updates to the client. On client there is a Quil sketch which only role is to draw world when new version is received. [code](https://github.com/nbeloglazov/snakejure/blob/master/src/snakejure/client.clj#L77). \r\n\r\nDoes it help with what you are trying to achieve? "

Also can you add 2 new testcases for the new functions in this file: https://github.com/quil/quil/blob/master/test/cljc/snippets/typography/attributes.cljc ? \r\nIf these functions are CLJ-only,  there is a way to limit these test to run only on clj. I can find examples if's the case. \r\n\r\nTo run tests on clj do\r\n```shell\r\nMANUAL=true lein test snippets.typography.attributes\r\n```\r\nfor cljs \r\n```shell\r\nlein with-profile cljs-testing ring server\r\n```\r\n\r\nThese test just print run sketch and you visually check that it's correct and no errors are throws. There is no automatic checks that compare sketch screenshot with some reference. Very low-tech at the moment :) "

        "body": "Add support for fullscreen. But it's different from Clojure. In ClojureScript all sketches fullscreen-capable by default and to trigger fullscreen press F11. Using `:size :fullscreen` doesn't work. The reason why I implemented it's differently is that in JS to make element fullscreen - the action must be triggered by user (mouse clickc or key press). So I can't just make sketch fullscreen when it starts. I decided to go with F11 because it's already somewhat standard \"fullscreen trigger\" button. "

Yes, you are right, Processing no longer users java applets, but they still call the main class `PApplet`. And Quil doesn't use use \"Applet\" in title. The default name of a sketch is \"Quil 1\": [code](https://github.com/quil/quil/blob/master/src/clj/quil/applet.clj#L299). At least that's what I'm getting now when running random sketch after @mishadoff fixed title handling. "

Java 9 will already be unsupported as of March 2018, and Java 10 will be unsupported just six months later in September 2018. As a result, there are no plans to support Java 9 or 10. The first version we might use is Java 11, a \"long term support\" release, scheduled for September 2018. However, without anyone contributing their time to rework the code for Java 9/10/11, we'll be using Java 8 for the foreseeable future.\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/processing/processing/wiki/Supported-Platforms\r\n\r\nSo maybe the best thing to do here is give an error and exit after checking `(System/getProperty \"java.version\")`\r\n"

It might be cool to include the need for <= jdk 8 in the docs.\r\n\r\nGetting jdk 8 to work after installing jdk 10 was not a straightforward expedition, so to anyone who runs into the same problem:\r\n\r\n* You can't completely remove jdk 10 with [the instructions from Oracle](https://www.java.com/en/download/help/mac_uninstall_java.xml). You will keep using java version 10 in your terminal, which you can check with `javac -version`.\r\n* To delete jdk 10 from your system, go to `/Library/Java/JavaVirtualMachines` (or the equivalent directory on Linux) and `sudo rm -rf` the jdk10 directory.\r\n* Install jdk8 from Oracle, and you're good to go"

        "body": "Thanks for the detailed bug report. I agree that it feels like `with-translation` should work with `set-pixel`. But we are using Processing's `translate` function for `with-translation` and I'm guessing it's not working for pixels. One possible reason is that translation is similar to rotation or scaling: it changes geometry of drawn shapes while pixel is not really a \"shape\": you can't really scale or rotate a pixel. Also you can pass fractions (e.g. 1/3) to `translate` and moving pixel by 1/3 wouldn't make match sense. So I think current behavior is working as intended even though it's unexpected in some situations. "

Check this \"signature of handler\" section in [this doc]( https://github.com/quil/quil/wiki/Functional-mode-%28fun-mode%29). Your code works in ClojureScript version because ClojureScript compiles to JavaScript and JS doesn't care if you pass fewer parameters to the function than it expects. But Clojure is stricter and number of parameters must matc. "

I remember going through jogamp code once figuring out how they load dependencies. \r\n\r\nThe rationale behind Quil's decision to use fat jar is somewhat the opposite: I didn't want users to do anything special beside including `quil` as dependency. Quil should be easy-to-use for people who might not be very familiar with clojure/leiningen so I sacrificed bandwidth for simplicity. Another reason for the fat jar is that it makes 'lein uberjar' possible out of box."

Will be useful to discuss what to do with added/removed functions.\r\n\r\nDraft changes: that actually looks pretty reasonable. I expected more drastic changes, glad to see that we probably won't need to rewrite sketch.cljs much. As for the flow: how about we create a branch on quil for p5js and commit changes there. I think we start with the basic changes to sketch.cljs and util.cljs without updating any snippets or core.cljc (which means the test will fail, but that's ok) and then incrementally test/fix API functions and corresponding snippets? \r\n\r\nSupporting both p5js and processing.js: that would be cool, but maybe it will involve too much complexity without any clear benefits. As Quil developer it'd be useful to quickly check regressions, but for Quil users it probably is not very important. So maybe we can omit this requirement. \r\n\r\ncljsjs/p5 and externs: didn't about that, glad that we can reuse existing library instead of creating our own p5js clojar. \r\n\r\nWhat do you think?"

        "body": "Looked at the `saturation` example. The problem is that `colorMode` hsb works differently in p5js. In processing.js and java processing calling `colorMode(HSB)` switched color mode to HSB with 255 being max for hue, saturation and brightness components. \r\n\r\nP5js changed that and `colorMode(HSB)` uses 360 as max for hue, 100 for saturation and 100 for brightness ([docs](https://p5js.org/reference/#/p5/colorMode)). If you try using `(q/color-mode :hsb 360 100 100)` with current Quil (processing.js) you'll get the same result: [sketch](http://quil.info/sketches/show/18c7305b2f5b6f1357b17445e0d924ad051d49ee2d0c84fe33978850e6fd47df). \r\n\r\nNow the question whether we should do something about it. I feel like it would be good if both clj and cljs versions behaved the same. It's one thing when some function is available in clj but not cljs (or vice versa), it's reasonable thing to expect. But having the exact same function produce very different results is another. We could change cljs `color-mode` version to always pass 255 when called with no arguments. \r\n\r\nWhat do you think? "

From the docs it looked to me that [colorMode in processing](https://processing.org/reference/colorMode_.html) is the same as p5.js because I saw `colorMode(HSB, 360, 100, 100)` and thought those were defaults when in fact it seems it is just an example. I would also go with changing `color-mode` to always pass 255 when called with no arguments. Will do this as part of next PR.\r\n\r\nYes I consider green as done i.e. migrated and ready to be released. My approach so far is a commit per function migrated and within the same commit I would adapt the snippet if necessary. My intention was to proceed top down with a PR per section, so typography would be next. For the functions which are not already migrated I've written in the notes column my intention of what to do for them.\r\n\r\nRegarding updating documentation for snippets I think the best approach is that you go top down because it would act as a review and it saves you from doing unnecessary work if I change a snippet significantly."

I'm wondering whether the issue with doseq loop itself or calculating you do inside it. \r\n2. Move `(state :mouse-theta)` outside of the loop as it doesn't change.\r\n3. Inline `cart2polar` as it uses destructuring and I have suspicion it might slow everything down.\r\n4.

Move `(q/pixels)` call outside of the loop and store in a variable.

        "body": "Thanks for the tips!\r\n\r\n> Generally clojure is not great in doing a lot of low level math operations\r\n\r\nGood to know. Maybe I am just barking up the wrong tree here and should follow some tutorials instead to explore what Quil and Clojure are really good at.\r\n\r\nBefore you replied, I actually added some more things and made the sketch a bit more complex (no pun intended, ha). I wrapped the x and y values into `let [z (cx/complex x y)]` so that I could manipulate it as in symbolic math. For example, plotting a polynomial complex function\r\n\r\n\u2593\u2593\u2593\u2593\u2593(\ud835\udc67\u00b3 - 2)(\ud835\udc67 + 2)\r\n\ud835\udc53(\ud835\udc67) = \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\r\n\u2593\u2593\u2593\u2593\u2593\u2593\u2593(\ud835\udc67 - 1)\r\n\r\nI set the `theta` value to increase every frame so I could confirm the raw speed (without the extra variable of mouse movement).\r\n\r\n![swirly_1](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/9534743/53028051-afc35c00-3498-11e9-9cc2-06636610e3b6.gif)\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, this is sped up 10000% (literally). In reality, each frame took 2 or 3 seconds.\r\n\r\nWith regard to (1), you would think that the extra calculation involved in the polynomial function would slow things down massively, but actually when I removed it and just plotted z with no extra calculations, it did not speed up.\r\n\r\nWith regard to (3), setting `r` and `theta` individually inline rather than using destructuring didn't seem to make any difference. \r\n\r\n(5) made a difference, but not as much as (4). I ran `lein check` and also set `(set! *warn-on-reflection* true)`.\r\n\r\nOne of the other things I had added was a check for `NaN` and `Inf` values. Unfortunately I could not seem to test for those values successfully with native Clojure functions, so I used conditions loike `(.equals Double/NaN re)` and `(.equals Double/POSITIVE_INFINITY re)`. Those resulted in reflection errors, and when I changed those to `(Double/isNaN re)` and `Double/isInfinite re)`, that sped things up considerably.\r\n\r\nThese errors, however, persist. Any ideas?\r\n```\r\nReflection warning, /Users/justin/Documents/GitHub/quil-experiments/src/quil_experiments/complex_plane.clj:80:3 - reference to field beginDraw can't be resolved.\r\nReflection warning, /Users/justin/Documents/GitHub/quil-experiments/src/quil_experiments/complex_plane.clj:80:3 - reference to field endDraw can't be resolved.\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn the end, though, it's still nowhere near fast enough to be usable. I originally thought that it had something to do with the pixels array, so I thought I'd try making a 1D array (Clojure vector) of Cartesian coordinates in `setup` and then `map` the transformations on the array to generate new color values.\r\n\r\n```Clojure\r\n(defn cartesian [dim]\r\n  (let [rng   (range (* -1 dim) (+ 1 dim))\r\n        xs    (cycle rng)\r\n        cols  (fn [x] (repeat (count rng) x))\r\n        ys    (mapcat cols (reverse rng))]\r\n    (map #(cx/complex %2 %1) xs ys))) ;; originally tested with #(vec [%2 %1])\r\n```\r\n\r\nI noticed that as soon as `dim` went above `150` (a 300x300 grid), performance degraded rapidly. So I think the main speed bump is simply the size of the array and the number of calculations that have to be done."

That way user doesn't need to how to check whether specific type of object finished loading. Also it gives us freedom to devise special custom ways of checking for loading. \r\n\r\nFor example I checked p5js code for p5.Geometry class which is returned from `loadModel` and couldn't see easy way to check whether it's finished loading or not. One way we could implement it ourselves is to pass callback to `loadModel` call and when callback is called set some custom 'quilModelLoaded' attribute on the Geometry instance and later check for this attribute from the `loaded?` function.\r\n\r\nI saw your suggestion about supporting `preload` but I'm somehwat hesitant about adding it as we would need to support it for java version as well and also somehow integrate with state object as preload supposed to load things so it'd make sense for this function to return these objects.  \r\n\r\nWhat do you think?

        "body": "While looking into your example I tried to implement `loadShader` in a way that it stores an atom on shader object and the atom is set to true when shader finishes loading. I implemented this code:\r\n\r\n```clj\r\n   #?(:clj (.loadShader (current-graphics) fragment-filename vertex-filename)\r\n      :cljs (let [loaded (atom false)\r\n                  shader (.loadShader (current-graphics) vertex-filename fragment-filename\r\n                                      (fn [] (reset! loaded true)))]\r\n                (aset shader \"quil-thing-loaded\" loaded)\r\n                shader))\r\n```\r\n\r\nthen tested and got error sayingthat `loadShader` takes only 2 arguments. And only then realized that [the pull request](https://github.com/processing/p5.js/pull/2996) that added callback support to `loadShader` is not released yet. Oh well. \r\n\r\nWithout it I was able to check whether shader is loaded by reading some of its private properties `_vertSrc` and `_fragSrc`. If both are set then shader is loaded. Here is a working example I got:\r\n\r\n```clj\r\n(ns sample\r\n  (:require [quil.core :as q :include-macros true]\r\n            [quil.middleware :as m]))\r\n\r\n(defn setup []\r\n  {:shader (q/load-shader \"/test/html/shader.frag\" \"/test/html/shader.vert\")})\r\n\r\n(defn draw-state [state]\r\n  (q/background 240)\r\n  (let [shd (:shader state)]\r\n    (when (and (aget shd \"_vertSrc\") (aget shd \"_fragSrc\"))\r\n      (q/shader shd)\r\n      (q/set-uniform shd \"p\" (array -0.74364388703 0.13182590421))\r\n      (q/set-uniform shd\r\n                     \"r\" (* 1.5 (q/exp (* -6.5 (+ 1 (q/sin (/ (q/millis) 2000)))))))\r\n      (q/quad -1 -1 1 -1 1 1 -1 1))))\r\n\r\n\r\n(q/defsketch my\r\n  :host \"host\"\r\n  :size [500 500]\r\n  :renderer :p3d\r\n  :setup setup\r\n  :draw draw-state\r\n  :middleware [m/fun-mode])\r\n```\r\n\r\nI feel like `loaded?` function I mentioned on your other pull request would help us to hide this terrible `vertSrc/fargSrc` check. And later we can switch to the better callback-based check. \r\n\r\nBtw I don't know if you use it, but I usually develop using `sample.cljs` mentioned in [Developing](https://github.com/quil/quil#developing) section. It automatically rebuilds when changing core.cljc so quite useful for quick iterations."

So here's the approach I'm using now, and it seems to have fixed the issue, for me, and _for the moment_:\r\n\r\n``` css\r\n.quil-sketch {\r\n  height: 0;\r\n  width: 100%;\r\n  padding-bottom: 100%;\r\n}\r\n\r\ncanvas {\r\n  max-width: 100%;\r\n  max-height: 100%;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThat is, I specified the `div` host style to \"want to be square\", and forced all `canvas` sizes to have maxima as indicated. It feels like there will be a problem some day farther on, maybe as soon as I want to have a non-square `quil` sketch, but for now this handles my problem on iOS with overflow and scaling.\r\n\r\nPerhaps though the \"real bug\" is that this should probably be better documented, since it seems to be (1) a good thing to have pretty graphics on expensive hardware, but (2) a nasty thing to try to debug if you don't notice the `width` tricks in `p5.js`...."

        "body": "The error you are seeing is caused by clojure lazy evaluation. In the first example `(repeat 10 (q/random-gaussian))` you call `(q/random-gaussian)` eagerly, while applet is bound to `my-project` and then `repeat` returns a lazy sequence of the same already-evaluated value.\r\n\r\nIn the second example when you call `(repeatedly 10 q/random-gaussian)` - it returns a lazy sequence without calling `random-gaussian`. By the time the sequence will be evaluated - the applet will no longer be bound to `my-project` and will be bound to `null` instead. One way to fix it is to eagerly evaluate sequence using `doall` before returning it:\r\n\r\n```clojure\r\n(quil.applet/with-applet my-project\r\n  (doall (repeatedly 10 q/random-gaussian))\r\n```\r\n\r\nHere is pure clojure example of the issue:\r\n\r\n```clojure\r\n(def ^:dynamic *foo* 5)\r\n(defn get-foo [] *foo*)\r\n\r\n(repeatedly 10 get-foo) ; => (5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5)\r\n\r\n(binding [*foo* 7] (repeatedly 10 get-foo)) ;  => (5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5)\r\n\r\n(binding [*foo* 7] (doall (repeatedly 10 get-foo))) ; => (7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7)\r\n```\r\n\r\nHope this explains the issue.

When I call `quil.core/resize`, strange behavior ensues. One specific observation I can make is that the relationship between CSS width/height and canvas width/height is lost. While initially the canvas will have a width and height of, say, 1400x1000, double that of the CSS height and width of 700x500, after calling `quil.core/resize`, all widths and heights are equal. The 2:1 relationship is not maintained. Please advise."

        "body": "Wow, that's great start! Couple of questions/thoughts:\r\n\r\n1. Running this test on different machines/os will likely result in subtly different images. So we'll need to have a way to set threshold image difference upon which test fails. I suspect kamera has some utilities for calculating such diffs between images (or maybe there are standalone clojure libraries for doing that).\r\n\r\n2. We might end up adding prefixes to images depending on environment they run. For example add OS name if rendering differs significantly on different OSes. That's how we do image based browser tests at work: each image contains browser + OS in its name so image on chrome differs from image on firefox. But I think we could start without suffixes and see how it goes. \r\n\r\n3. Skipped snippets to due randomnes. I can't think of a good solution. We might just keep them skipped. \r\n\r\n4. CI for Quil. There is no CI setup. Because current test (run all snippets) doesn't really check much beside that it doesn't throw error I didn't bother setting up CI. But yes, with image tests we should have one. One thing is Quil tests require some graphics things and it might require more setup on CI part? I assume CI usually assumes there is no UI and runs them on display-less servers. But then I'm sure CI support browser tests with screenshots so there should an option to have CI with display. I'm ok with either Travis or CircleCI as long as it has display thing for Quil. "

        "body": "I would highly recommend profiling this with something like http://clojure-goes-fast.com/blog/clj-async-profiler-tips/ to see what part of the function is actually taking the most time. I've also had luck using the same author's library for decompiling to see what code is actually getting generated.\r\n\r\nI've been doing some of this type of optimization for my own projects which are using live video as a source frame and found a couple of type hints and spot replacing a few functions really sped things up. I have a couple of notes on things above that might be worth investigating the cost.\r\n\r\nThe call to `aset-int` may need a type-hint on the target array, ie I've found that in some cases I needed to do `(aset-int ^ints pixels value)` in order to generate performant code. I would be cautious about any functions on the inside of a pixel bashing loop that need to call quil functions that check something on the applet. So as example it might be worth lifting the call to `(q/pixels)` out of the loop and into a variable to keep it a local instead of a per pixel function call. Another culprit I found in my own projects was that `(q/color)` does a dereference into `(q/current-applet)` to figure out what color mode to use. It may be worth it to write your own typehinted color conversion functions that can stay local in the loop. Finally, I'm a little suspicious of the use of `doseq`. You might have better luck using two nested `dotimes` and then doing the offset math using unchecked variants in your own let function inside. In general you just want to minimize the expensive work happening inside of the inner loop.\r\n\r\nProfiling is really key though, because otherwise you won't know what is cheap and what is costly. Good luck!"

        "body": "Thanks for your feedback. Some minor things which came up along the way:\r\n\r\n* The 1 second pause in the snippet tests causes a problem with snippets `redraw` and `blend`. They both have `no-loop` in `setup` and when they render fast enough I think `q/exit` is never called. Does it make sense to say that if the developer wants to look at the output he should use the `manual` option? This would resolve the issue and also make the build faster.\r\n\r\n* Also ran into an issue with `ortho-perspective` snippet locally. It seems to be related to picking a frame-rate of 1 because when I remove this I don't see the issue anymore. This is an excerpt from what I see in the console: `\r\nfinishLifecycleAction(com.jogamp.opengl.util.FPSAnimator$3): ++++++ timeout reached ++++++ main-FPSAWTAnimator#15-Timer30`. While I like the comparison on each frame between ortho and perspective I chose to adapt the snippet to render both side by side statically as it makes more sense anyway for automated testing. What do you think?\r\n\r\n* Regarding CI, after experimenting locally settled on `image: circleci/clojure:lein-2.8.3-browsers`. If I understood correctly this image uses [xvfb](https://github.com/CircleCI-Public/circleci-dockerfiles/blob/master/clojure/images/lein-2.8.1/browsers/Dockerfile#L63) which allows us to follow [guidelines from processing for running without a display](https://github.com/processing/processing/wiki/Running-without-a-Display). You can see the output [here](https://circleci.com/gh/anthonygalea/quil/2) as well as run build locally if you want:\r\n```bash\r\nbrew install circleci #or equivalent if on different os\r\ncircleci local execute --job build\r\n```\r\n\r\n* The only remaining issue with regards to CI is with opengl. Still need to look into this:\r\n```\r\n actual: com.jogamp.opengl.GLException: Profiles [GL4bc, GL4, GL3bc, GL3, GLES3, GL2, GLES2] not available on device X11GraphicsDevice[type .x11, connection :99, unitID 0, handle 0x0, owner false, ResourceToolkitLock[obj 0x590cdf9, isOwner false, <6527a4eb, 5b22112a>[count 0, qsz 0, owner <NULL>]]]\r\n at com.jogamp.opengl.GLProfile.get (GLProfile.java:1039)\r\n    com.jogamp.opengl.GLProfile.get (GLProfile.java:1050)\r\n```\r\n\r\n* Regarding threshold for comparison I will see what is possible with kamera."

Actually I think we might end up having some snippets to be marked only for testing and some only for showing on quil.info. For example for ortho/perspectiive as example it's nice to have flip but for testing it doesn't make sense as you found out. I suspect we are going to have more such cases. \r\n\r\n> What I still haven't figured out is what to do about the opengl exceptions when running in the container. Any ideas?\r\n\r\nNo :( I'm ok with partial support for clj. And then having better support for cljs (web). Hopefully when running in browser webgl works better on CI compared to opengl. \r\n"
