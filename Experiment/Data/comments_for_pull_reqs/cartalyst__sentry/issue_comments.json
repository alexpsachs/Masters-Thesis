They add complexity to databases and while they are there for speed and data integrity we feel that we do not want to ship them with Sentry.\n\nI really appreciate your time though. What I'd suggest doing is having your own migration which looks something like this:\n\n``` php\n\npublic function up()\n{\n    \\Command::call('migrate', array('--package' => 'cartalyst/sentry'));\n\n    \\Schema::table('users', function($table)\n    {\n         // Add foreign keys\n    });\n}\n\n```\n"

We don't use Facades in the context of Sentry at all. This PR would need to be completely refactored to make it work I'm afraid.\n\nAlso, unit tests need to be updated as the build is failing.\n\nYou can change the models used (as a config option) and do:\n\n``` php\nprotected $table = 'my_users_table';\n```\n\nIn each model you have sub-classed.\n"

However, if your extent of Sentry usage is just methods through the Sentry class (i.e., `Sentry::authenticate()`, `Sentry::register()` [essentially what's documented] etc), then the upgrade path should be completely benign.

The great thing about how I've structured it is, you only need to override one method from `BasePermissions`, which is `preparePermissions()`. That will return a flat array of permissions, using whatever logic it wants. This is where you'll build the array of group permissions, and then remove the group permissions who are present in the user object :) Just return that array, and everything will work :) Cool, eh?\n"

At this stage, the object is initialised with all user and group permissions (which will load fast through our eloquent drivers as we'll use full eager loading and query caching where possible).\n\nYou need to iterate through and give back a flat array of permissions. So, the way I'd do it is, loop through all user permissions and put them in the flat array. Then, loop through groups. Only add the group if the permission doesn't exist in the user permissions (regardless of it's value).\n\nI'd stash what you have done and pull in the latest stuff I pushed, you'll see the method there to override :)\n"

It's tested in a real app, I haven't pushed all the unit tests yet.\n\nPlease [download the demo app](https://github.com/cartalyst/sentry-3-demo/) and:\n1. Install dependencies through composer\n2. Configure database and migrate with `--package=cartalyst/sentry` option.\n3. Visit `/register` on the virtual host you setup.\n\nBy default, we are using throttling and activation checks. To enable SwiftIdentity, simply register on their site, then publish Sentry's config and follow the instructions there (be sure to configure the `swift` component and also enable it as a `checkpoint`).\n\nDocs coming soon, but would love to get the public involved in the early testing of Sentry 3!\n"

I looked at your implementation and I see you forcefully disable the throttle.\n\nI also like the idea of creating the user if no user is found, but I'm trying to think about how to keep throttling around as well. Could be a bit tricky. I guess this also exposes an issue with the master Sentry branch -- throttling may not be used if the user does not exist. I don't think there's a solution for this, just something to be aware of. So throttling protects against brute forcing a password, but not from guessing usernames.\n\nIn any case, I did want to say that I do use ldap. You're not the only one. I enjoyed reviewing how you implemented this, and I may do something similar.\n"

Could be a bit tricky. I guess this also exposes an issue with the master Sentry branch -- throttling may not be used if the user does not exist. I don't think there's a solution for this, just something to be aware of.

        "body": "Personally, I am happy with whatever, however please consider the following in relation to PHP stability, testing and security before making a decision:\n\nEnterprise or Server distributions of Linux tend to lag behind on\nversion numbers of software like PHP.  This reflects the need for a well\ntested and stable platform to ensure that the services provided will not\nexperience unexpected downtime.  As a result, the latest versions of\nRedhat and CentOS currently include PHP version numbers up to 5.3, and\neven the yet-to-be-released RedHat Enterprise 7 is only expected to ship\nPHP 5.4.  The same is true of other major Enterprise distributions -\nthey do not include the 5.5 series of PHP because it was not considered\nsufficiently tested at the time of release.\n\nThis means that for some hosting servers, PHP 5.4 and 5.5 would have to be manually compiled / updated and would not come in the form of official RPM packages, but in the form of 3rd party packages.\n\nDepending on the data stored within the application - e.g. those which require compliance / audit / certification such as HIPAA or PCI - Many hosting providers will not be able to provide any form of guarantee of stability or security for 3rd party package installations of PHP because they were not released as part of the official Linux distribution.\n\nFurther, do you really want to force people to have to install a newer version of PHP from a 3rd party repo because it is not actually available in their native Linux Distribution?\n"

IMHO it would be better to mock out only the storage backend implementations so that the relationships are also tested correctly, but that would require a complete rework of the tests.\n\nBy putting the cache clearing into separate methods, the tests can check that those methods get invoked. If you have some other way to make the tests actually verify that the data is cleared, that would be fine too, of course.\n"

        "body": "@drsii You're mistakenly using quantity as a useful metric. Many of the packages are only really useful when using the entire Platform app. And while I could use some separately, with the relatively poor documentation, I need to figure out what each even does and how to use it on my own. Not what I expect from a paid product.\n\nAs for \"too slow\"... all one has to do is read back through this thread. For the last 3-6 months this package has been \"relatively stable\" and will be released \"once we have time to finish the docs and tests, not a big priority atm\". This is really frustrating when the support model is time-based subscriptions.\n\nDuring my three-month subscription, relatively little development occurred on the two packages I was most interested in (API and Sentry), and communication was always of the sort \"it's coming soon\". Not something that is useful to me when I'm trying to build client projects, and need to make reliable estimates. Furthermore, even though contributions are appreciated, the subscription model means that I'm hesitant to get too invested in these packages, or to spend too much time contributing my development resources for something I'll still need to continually pay for. Sorta the worst of both worlds (open source vs. paid/closed source)...\n\nUltimately I did not use either package, because stable releases did not look to be coming soon. And therefore let my subscription expire. Anyway, this is just meant as feedback on why I'd be hesitant to sign up again without a clear value proposition. I'm glad you are experimenting with ways to make open-source development sustainable, and I applaud and fully support that, I just don't think you've nailed it yet...\n"

It was hard to justify resources into a free package, i have invested considerably into Sentry over the past 2 years and I want to see it succeed. Now we can make that happen. \n\nIn regards to the API I completely understand. The issue behind the reasons for that have been resolved. @suwardany will be taking the lead on the package, and seeing it through where we wanted it to be. \n\nThis is indeed a tricky model. We're forging new ground, and we are doing it purely bootstrapped. I hope we do nail it soon, as I believe wholeheartedly that it can work. In the mean time I am adding you back to the subscribers for another 3 months. I hope by then we have addressed your concerns and you see value in the service once again. \n"
