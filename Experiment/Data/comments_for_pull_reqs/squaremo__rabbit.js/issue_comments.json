It's an easy way to leak resources.\nAlso, there's no notion of acknowledging messages sent to the browser, so this wouldn't actually stop messages getting dropped.\n\nIf you can think of a sensible semantics for durable subscriptions from browsers that avoids those problems, I am happy to consider it. Possibly connections should just have some more in-built reliability.\n\nYour implementation is a bit odd. Firstly, you use the same queue name for all the subscribers, which would mean that they compete as consumers (i.e., each message would go to only one subscriber). Secondly, you create a direct exchange and always bind the queue using an empty string, so it's effectively a fanout exchange anyway.\n"

I want my browser to publish a message but also subscribe to the same exchange such that it receives the message back. When I first start node and load up the page, everything works swimmingly. However, when I refresh the pub works from the browser but it stops receiving any messages. So my real question is how do you have both a pub and sub SockJS connection open with the browser? Am I perhaps not properly closing the connection upon refresh? \n\nI've tried one method, which might not be good (as I am guessing these are considered separate sockjs connections):\n\nvar sock = new SockJS(\"http://mydomain:5918/socks\");\nsock.onopen = function() {\n    sock.send('pub comments');\n}\n\nvar sock_rec=new SockJS(\"http://mydomain:5918/socks\");\nsock_rec.onopen=function() {\n  sock_rec.send('sub comments');\n}\n\nsock_rec.onmessage = function(msg) {\n    console.log('got a message');\n    console.log(msg);\n    var raw_data=JSON.parse(msg.data);\n    var data=raw_data['comment'] + ' posted by ' + raw_data['username'] + ' ' + raw_data['time'] + '<br>';\n\n```\n   var childContent= new dijit.layout.ContentPane({\n                       content:data\n        });\n    childContent.placeAt(commentPane.containerNode,'last');\n```\n\n};\n"

I'm such an ignoramus with this stuff...\n\nBut I think maybe a better way is to just have the browser do a pub\nand send back the message from node back over the Sockjs connection.\nThat seems simpler!\n\nOn Thu, Jan 5, 2012 at 10:10 AM, Michael Bridgen\nreply@reply.github.com\nwrote:\n\n> @fostercraig: To be honest I am not completely sure of the reconnect semantics of SockJS.

That's not how rabbit.js works right now, but as it happens, I am changing things around to make that much easier.\n\nSpecifically, I'm giving making socket() the top-level abstraction, rather than listen(), and making the sockets implement the Stream interface so you can just pipe from whatever to whatever; e.g., in your scenario you can pipe a sub socket into the SockJS connection and the SockJS connection into a pub socket. If that doesn't make any sense wait a bit for the readme changes -- all will become clear! Well, fingers crossed.\n"

        "body": "OK so this is one-way, as in, you're not posting replies to the work items? And I presume the reason for using acknowledgements is for some kind of reliability: if the task processing fails and takes down the socket or connection, the message will be requeued and given to another worker if there is one, or possibly the crashed and restarted worker.\n\nIf you need this kind of reliability, then have workers reply to tasks, and have processes that post tasks resend them if they don't get a reply within some timeout. If you use replies, rabbit.js could (though it doesn't currently) use the lack of an acknowledgement to short-circuit this and resend itself if the worker process dies. Replies may also be useful for rate-limiting task-producers so that tasks don't back up.\n\nIf you don't want to send replies, there's no place for rabbit.js to say \"ok this message is handled\"; I guess it could acknowledge each message after emitting a data event, but I don't think this really buys a lot.\n\nIf you're attached to using (one-hop) acknowledgements, you may want to just use the AMQP client library.\n\nI may look at adding sockopts for blocking and unblocking the receive buffer, but by that stage it is getting as complicated as AMQP and that's something I definitely don't want. If you've another idea I'd be happy to discuss it.\n"

(I do some work on that, including an in-progress API cleanup, so I would be interested to hear your views).\n\nOn the error event: yep, I agree rabbit.js should expose errors rather than swallow them or splode. Let me think about that one a bit.\n\nOn the `opts` parameters: hem. haw. hrrm. Yar, use your fork for the time being. I'll see if the idea grows on me.\n\nCheers, thanks for taking an interest in rabbit.js,\n-M\n"

All of those that read from a socket have the messages buffered in a queue.\n\nIf you're trying to interoperate with AMQP clients, though, it helps to know that PUSH sockets and REQ sockets both publish to the queue that they are connected to. E.g., in\n\n```\n$ var push = context.socket('PUSH');\n$ push.connect('foobar');\n$ push.write(\"here is some stuff\", 'utf8');\n```\n\nthe message gets sent to a shared queue called 'foobar'.\n"

Do you mind if I post this to the rabbitmq mailing list to see what people make of it? Also not sure why so many connections -- are there other vhosts set up?\n\nIn the meantime, one way to check that it's the blocked connection that's keeping messages from getting through is to look at whether Node has to buffer things itself; an increasing `context._connection.bufferSize` will tell you that.\n"

Server2 will only analyse the incoming message to determine the target but no real processing will be done there (except logging all incoming messages). Once it has forwarded the request, it should wait for the reply and forward the reply to server1.\n\nMultiple module should be able to send messages to server2 and wait for the worker's response. Is a simple REQ/REP the best approach in this case ?\n\nThanks,\nLuc\n"

I will need to study all of this much deeper but I'm convinced rabbitmq will be the good choice.\nRight now, I'm struggling to design the architecture I will need knowing that each module should be able to:\n- send a request on a given socket and receive a response on this same socket\n- receive a request on another socket it listens to, process it and send a response to the sender\n- send a request that should be broadcasted to all the other module (though rabbitmq (the server2 of my example)).\n\nThanks a lot for your help.\nLuc\n"

(AMQP is no better in this respect, -- you have a bit more control over what happens when, but no more guarantees)\n\nMy resistance to this additional complication is based on the assumption that people use rabbit.js as its own abstraction -- simple messaging that happens to use RabbitMQ -- whereas _maybe_ people use it only because the node AMQP library is a bit of a shambles. @josephholsten, @jgornick, is that latter the case for you?\n"

        "body": "Hi Michael, \nIMHO the simplest way to go about writing a library interface API to rabbit.js is to expose all the functionality of rabbitMQ in an easy to use way and give users access to provisioning and controlling all the features rabbitMQ has to offer. Hence letting users write their own abstraction levels via their application layer if they so desire. Of course users can use AMQP directly, but that is too low level and not necessarily rabbitMQ-centric.\nBy making certain assumptions (and thus hardcoding options - ie \"the handful of permutations\"), you probably fit the bill for a percentage of use-cases, but as it so happens, most people (including myself) need more flexibility/control over lifetime of messages, queues, exchanges, etc. Also, as you can see, most forked projects from your codebase, have been branched off especially for this reason - more control over certain options. There is even a new project https://github.com/adrai/rabbitmq-nodejs-client which was redesigned for the ground up, because this library was too restrictive. I had to struggle a lot to understand the use of options in this library and took an equal amount of time to figure out what I can and cannot do to leverage rabbitMQ. By exposing all options, users 1) know exactly what they can change w/o having to guess what the option nomenclature is 2) can see exactly what each default setting is 3) can change each setting as per their own application needs. I also took care in segregating exchange, queue and message options. I believe your API muddles the lines a bit. Your library is very well written, so it's a bit of a shame IMHO not to use it to its full extent! \nAlso my development requests which I opened were addressed in this pull request. \n"

A better route to that is an AMQP library with RabbitMQ's extensions added into the protocol (e.g., exchange to exchange bindings, publisher acknowledgments). My intention was to have a simple messaging model that aligned with the Node.JS way of things fairly well, that happened to use RabbitMQ.\n\nIt's become apparent since that some people are using rabbit.js because node-amqp is too complicated (which it inherits from AMQP) and inconsistent in some places (e.g., some methods return promises and some don't). Some of those people find that some things they need, that they know RabbitMQ does, are missing from rabbit.js; for example, acknowledgements. I'm willing to grow rabbit.js in those directions if that will make life easier, since that's after all the point of the exercise -- on a case-by-case basis, and addressing the actual problem people are having.\n\n> By making certain assumptions (and thus hardcoding options - ie \"the handful of permutations\"), you probably fit \n> the bill for a percentage of use-cases, but as it so happens, most people (including myself) need more \n> flexibility/control over lifetime of messages, queues, exchanges, etc.\n> By exposing all options, users 1) know exactly what they can change w/o having to guess what the option \n> nomenclature is 2) can see exactly what each default setting is 3) can change each setting as per their own \n> application needs.

For example, message lifetime, or dead-lettering. But again I'd want to look at these on a case-by-case basis, and be very deliberate about how they are exposed.\n\nSo, all in all, I would rather look at your development requests individually than accept this pull request. I appreciate you likely spent a fair bit of time on it. Perhaps with a bit more consideration we can come up with a mechanism that allows flexibility you need, without sacrificing the simplicity of rabbit.js.\n"

        "body": "Hi Michael, thanks for the reply.\nHowever I would like to add one more thing. My proposed API is exactly equal in all respects to your API, except that you can just pass more options. You do allow some options to be passed (so it's not a total abstraction), and so my version just allows a few more (we're talking additional properties of the same JSON object here). The simplicity is still there. Users can still use the \"same\" subset of options as before. Their REQ/REP or PUB/SUB will behave in exactly the same way. I can send you code snippets which i'm using in production and you will see that creating a PUB/SUB is just as easy and straightforward as before. So users are not sacrificing anything and it is definitely NOT as complex as using AMQP directly. WIN-WIN in my opinion. But I'm willing to work with you on defining some other interface if you want...it's hard for me to keep sync-ing code and maintaining my branch all the time. I was hoping we could somehow merge both ideologies. \n"

To be fair, it was working by coincidence in the first place.\n\nIn v0.8, an EventEmitter's event listener map is created lazily in a method, while in v0.10 it's created in the constructor. Using util#inherits avoids this by not invoking the EventEmitter constructor (https://github.com/joyent/node/blob/master/lib/util.js), referring instead to the prototype.\n"

You'll also have to ask the PUB socket to send persistent messages.\n\nI can see there's a use for persistent subscriptions (not missing messages); although, ZeroMQ dropped this feature, possibly because it's too easy to leak queues if you don't reconnect. But as I've said elsewhere, I don't think the way to extend rabbit.js is to just expose AMQP in all its wartiness. If you truly want all the options, just use the AMQP client.\n"

You're quite correct, it doesn't destroy the exchange on the server; it just closes the channel that represents the exchange in the client. Having a channel for each exchange is kind of weird but that's node-amqp for you.\n\nOne thing I don't quite get: are you publishing to a new exchange each time? Because I thought node-amqp cached open exchanges, so if you are always publishing to the same place, you'll get back the same exchange object -- so no channel leak.\n\nWhat I am worried about is this scenario:\n\n```\n1. socket#1 connect to 'foo'\n2. socket#2 connect to 'foo'\n3. socket#1 publish and close\n4. socket#2 publish -- but 'foo' is closed\n```\n"

        "body": "I took a look at the node-amqp code. Oh dear.\n\nnode-amqp will always create a new channel every time you use `Connection#exchange()` or `Connection#queue()`. It also records them, indexed by the name. So, if you call `Connection#exchange()` twice with the same name, it will forget about the first one.\n\n\"Why does it record them?\" you might ask. Well, there appears to be two reasons. One is that it tries to keep track of bindings, so if I use queue.bind it'll increment a counter on the exchange mentioned (never mind that bindings are idempotent, or that it overwrites its records); the second is that there's some kind of reconnect mechanism whereby exchanges and queues are reinstated. It doesn't look like that could ever work, but maybe I'm missing something there.\n\nThe good news is that since it's not (or no longer?) caching them, always closing things once you're done is totally fine.\n"

Firstly, AMQP is stupid (who knew?): ifUnused will cause the channel to break should the queue or exchange be in fact used. Secondly, it wouldn't help anyway, because \"used\" means the wrong thing from our point of view. In the case of exchanges, it means bindings from the exchange, which won't always be in place (e.g., if there are no sub sockets at the time). In the case of queues, it means consumers, which again may not be in place.\n\n> Thinking aloud: is Socket#destroy() appropriate for this?\n\nNo, of course not, me. That's for invalidating the whole socket.\n"

The intermediaries can pass things along as fast as they get them, _provided_ the end points are synchronous. If they aren't, then as you've identified, answers could come back out of order. In the case of Rabbit.JS, RabbitMQ is the intermediary, of course.\n\nYou could keep a window of correlationIds at the requester, and only yield a message when the head correlationId has a reply.

One can no longer pipe it through streams that deal with raw binary data. Similarly, you'd have to `write` your binary data with a `correlationId`, removing the ability to pipe binary streams back as a response.\n\nThat's why I have a problem with my proposed approach: the streams aren't as general-purpose anymore.\n"

Assume that the processor takes 800ms including RTT for the entire transaction, pass or fail. If you need to handle hundreds/second, you'll need to pool--as you said--or create far more responders.

        "body": "There's some non-determinism working against you here. Specifically, the server hasn't necessarily finished closing the first sub socket by the time you're opening the second. This means two things: it hasn't released its \"exclusive\" lock on the queue (that which is named by `\"subs.*\"`), and it hasn't necessarily stopped delivering messages to the first socket.\n\nWith regard to that latter: I think, though I'll have to check, that amqplib stops processing any deliveries once you've closed the channel (quite reasonably, and in fact it's a requirement of the AMQP specification), which is why the `'data'` event doesn't fire. It's also the case that amqplib multiplexes \"fairly\" among channels -- more apparent non-determinism -- which might be how the PUB socket's message can seemingly overtake the SUB socket's close.\n\nYou can see it working by introducing a delay -- it can be small delay, but perhaps not as small as setImmediate -- after `sub.close()`. It's enough time for the server to release the lock on the subscription queue and for the first socket's 'consume' to be torn down.\n\nOh, and there's another thing at work here, which is a breaking change I've introduced in master (but not in a release, yet): you have to call e.g., `sub.subscribe()` on a SUB socket to receive messages. Technically it's `sub.subscribe(topic)` for some `topic`(s), but a falsey value works fine in the default case.\n\nTo be honest I am still working on these features, and actually I'm a bit undecided about them, or at least how they work at present.\n"

There is still some message loss possible -- in fact probable, if there's a fairly constant message flow.

There's synchronisation required whatever you do.\n\nRabbitMQ and AMQP won't help you with this, or not much. There's no provision for consumers catching up with old messages. If you cannot miss messages, better to stick them in a database and replay them for new subscribers, although you still have a kind of synchronisation problem (that is, figuring out when to switch from the replayed messages to the freshly-published messages).\n"

One is that writes don't get buffered at the (rabbit.js) socket, they are given straight to the AMQP client. The second is that Socket#close closes the AMQP client channel, which won't take effect until any writes are flushed. In other words, things should happen in the order that you do them.\n\nThat's the theory anyhow. Are you doing the `setImmediate()` because you ran into a problem with just closing the socket after writing?\n"

Did it mean 'context'? That would be slightly different, since closing the underlying connection discards anything not yet sent. You'd want to synchronise on closing any sockets you have, first.

Therefore, I always write this as\n\n``` js\nwhen(foo).then(bar).then(null, errorHandler)\n```\n\nthat way, the error handler is the last part and if `bar` throws an error, it gets handled. \n"

There are buffers in-between a rabbit.js socket and the network socket, and 'finish' does not compose in the sense that 'finish' from the buffer you are dealing with does not mean 'finish' in the operating system buffer.\n\nJust to be clear, does `done()` exit the program?\n"

        "body": "i have multiple scenarios with multiple projects that see a need for this, all of which come down to either doing more work on the receiving end, or having a ton of queues names for specific message types. \n\nin one project, i am sending job requests - things that need to be run. i had originally set up the job queues with their own name, like `job:job-a` and `job:job-b`. I was using push / worker for this, because I need jobs that will wait in the queue until something is available to handle them, and I want to `.ack()` the message. \n\nin another project, i have Stripe integration for payment processing. Stripe sends me a webhook for events related to customers, subscriptions, etc. I don't want to process the webhook in the http thread, so I'm sending the messages across my queues. I need a different handler for each of the events that I need to handle. i also need to make sure these events are handled. These need to be persistent messages. i was originally going to do the same as the previous project where I have named queues for each message type and use push / worker for this. i would end up with 5 or 10 names queues for this, to start with... `stripe:invoice.updated`, `stripe:customer.created`, etc.\n\ni just keep coming back to the need for named queues, with persistence, to send messages based on routing.\n\nam i thinking about this wrong? does it matter that i end up with 20 or 30 queues, named after the message type? that seems a bit backward to me... and every time i try to go down this path just one more time, i find myself thinking that the problem i'm facing would be better solved with exchanges and routing slips. \n"

        "body": "I think I see: you have a bunch of different kinds of job, and you want to be able to partition them into a smaller number of queues, for workers to pick up.\n\nYou could partition things statically, by choosing your partitions ahead of time and naming the queues for them. In effect the producers and consumers then have to know the routing -- e.g., \"I have a stripe:invoice.created, so it goes in the 'stripe:invoice' queue, then the consumer can look at it in more detail\". But I can see why your mind returns to exchanges and routing -- it seems like this ought to be dynamic.\n\nA bit of ancient history: In JMS there's the notion of a 'selector', which is like a queue query. You can consume from a queue while supplying a selector, to filter the messages that you're interested in.\n\nAMQP, which derives in large part from JMS, doesn't have selectors. They are supposed to be subsumed by exchanges and routing (which also supposedly cover JMS Topics), but sadly, the designers of AMQP missed a trick: selectors do something like routing _while also_ guaranteeing that 1. messages won't be dropped on the floor if no-one's there to listen, and 2. only one consumer will see each message. There's just no way to do those in AMQP.\n\nNow back to the present. You can probably see where problems will arise: there's no way to guarantee that messages won't be dropped on the floor, if the _producers_ don't know how they will get routed, since each message will go through an exchange and there may not be a binding in place to route it to a queue.\n\nThere's ways to mitigate this in AMQP -- using the mandatory (\"return if unroutable\") flag, among others -- but they break the simplicity of the rabbit.js model, and I'd like to avoid that.\n\nThere's no inherent problem with having tens of queues, by the way -- the messages would get buffered somewhere, and partitioning them into queues gives the right semantics (each message to one worker). Maybe there's some way the API can be more convenient though? For workers it's not too bad, you just `#connect` to each queue you care about. For producers though, well you'd have to have a socket per type of job, and pick the right one. On the other hand, something like `#publish`, where you mention the job type when you send the message, wouldn't guarantee that there's a queue at the other end (or at least, it would be expensive to do so). Perhaps:\n\n``` js\nvar jobs = ctx.socket('TASK');\n// Connect to all the task queues we will want to send to\njobs.connect('stripe:customer.created');\njobs.connect('stripe:customer.updated');\n// ...\n\n// Send to a specific task queue\njobs.send('stripe:customer.created', JSON.stringify(job), 'utf8');\n```\n\nNote there's absolutely no wildcard trickiness possible, it's all still sending straight to queues.\n"

        "body": "Thanks for the detailed response - the comparison to JMS is especially helpful (spent 2 years in that world, previously) \n\nIn the case of Stripe, it's pretty easy for me to know up-front which queues I need. I only have a few specific webhooks to handle.\n\nBut with the job system... there are hundreds of jobs and dozens of job types that will be built, changed, maintained and updated over the years. It's not something that can be set up front and have hard coded. I could have a configuration file that I read as needed, but this would be an additional process added to the job configuration process - which is already a complex system and prone to human error. It's technically possible, but is very much a usability problem with all the maintenance and work that happens on the jobs. \n\n... what about dead letter queues? i haven't done anything with these in rabbitmq, yet, but i would wonder if an exchange can be configured to catch missed messages in the dead letter queue?\n"

It would be nice to have the best of both worlds -- that is, to be able to verify that you won't miss messages, _and_ to be able to have a rolling evolution of the system. But that's probably outside the scope of rabbit.js, if not the system you're building.\n\nIn any case, alternate exchanges and dead lettering will help you keep track of exceptions at runtime -- messages that don't get processed either because no-one's listening, or because whoever got it was unable to process it. In recent versions of RabbitMQ you can set these with a \"policy\", i.e., apply them to exchanges and queues as matched by a regexp you give. (In less recent versions they are an argument to exchange.declare or queue.declare.)\n\nSetting an \"alternate exchange\" will give you catch-all route for messages that would otherwise get dropped. Dead lettering and per-queue expiration will give you unprocessed messages. I think these are out-of-scope for rabbit.js, but you can certainly use rabbit.js to get at the messages, by e.g., routing dead letters to a queue and having a worker socket in its own process to log them all, blink a red LED, email an operator or whatever.\n\nSo with all that in mind, what do you think of the TASK socket?\n"

The question is, do you need wildcard matching?\n\nI _think_ you're suggesting that you will, so you can send to `\"job.foo.frobnicate\"` and have a worker that's dealing with `\"job.foo.*\"`, rather than mention frobnication specifically. I would point out that you have to change code _somewhere_ to send new kinds of job, and that you can start extra workers to pick up the new kinds of job while you change the old workers to handle it. In the wildcard case, the old worker would just start getting jobs it didn't know how to handle.\nBut perhaps I'm off on a tangent.\n"

Each connection creates resources in the RabbitMQ broker (queues, exchanges), and not all of these can be garbage collected.\n\nFor most programs, it's not a big deal, since they will usually connect to the same addresses again and again. But say a program generated random addresses to connect to, and connected and disconnected repeatedly -- then it would leave junk around.\n\nThe reason it's difficult is that deleting the resources when the socket is closed is the wrong thing to do -- what if another socket is connected to the same resources (which after all is the whole point!). AMQP has some means by which unused resources will be removed, but they are not adequate.\n"

        "body": "I just realized immediately after writing this issue what the problem is and what exactly is going on with my code.\n\nThe problem is that the event handlers for both 'error' and 'data' events on the socket are being registered to the socket before any response from the socket. Therefore, when the first response from 'method1' comes back, both of the functions attach to the socket get invoked (and removed because they're attached with the .once EventEmitter method). When the response from 'method2' comes around, there are no event handlers to handle it, thus it passes by silently.\n\nSo the issue is apparent. However, the solution isn't so clear to me yet. It seems like what I would need to do is generate a unique ID for each payload, and then invoke the appropriate callback using this ID. \n\nOr, maybe I should just create a new socket object for every request. My only concern here is with efficiency and memory leaks. Also, would this even solve the issue; wouldn't each new socket get the same 'data' events written to it?\n"

I was under the impression that if the broker did not receive an acknowledgement within a period of time, it would automatically requeue the message, hence the notion of simply ignoring it.  \n\nThe purpose of my request is indeed to requeue the message.  It looks like RabbitMQ support #nack, with the option to requeue or not.  Maybe this would be the appropriate way to handle this?  (see: http://www.rabbitmq.com/nack.html)\n"

There's also limited space -- the header has up to 255 chars, and both queue names and exchange names are up to 255 chars.\n2. Having routing in the middle breaks the REQ/REP contract. Requests can be dropped if there's no-one currently listening, or go to more than one replier, and the requesting socket won't know whether or not to expect an answer, or more than one answer. See the discussion under #57.\n"

We're going to put the basic namespacing we want in our queue names. Those complications are pretty good reasons for us not to bother with the patching. So thanks for that response, much appreciated.\n\nI don't think that sticking the reply queues on a specific exchange is really that important. Putting the request queues on a topic exchange with a routing key scheme that matches something like \"service.subsystem.method\" would still be nice though. I'm not 100% clear what you meant by, \"Having routing in the middle breaks the REQ/REP contract\". If it's just requests on another exchange, I don't think that would break it right? The point is just to have a direct exchange for the message going back from the server node. Even if it wasn't the default exchange, as long as the reply_to queue is on a direct exchange it's no biggie right?\n"

The reason it's not -- I suspect (I'll investigate further) -- is that the request socket wants to acknowledge the message after the handler has run, and since you're closing it, it tries to do the ack on an invalid channel.\n\nUsing nextTick or setImmediate is a good work-around for now. Probably `#end` and `#close` ought to do this themselves, to avoid this situation.\n"

I suppose it could be a property set on the buffer, but that seems kind of gross -- also, whatever you're passing it on to would have to know to tell you once it's done -- so you may as well give it a future or callback or whatever, rather than an ID.\n"

        "body": "> I think that you can send, along the message, the deliveryTag that message has. As I see [1] the readable.push method, I think this change will break the current API, as it allows only a Buffer or a String\n\nOne can always set a property on the buffer or string -- it's JavaScript after all. But I don't like this solution, because the receiver has to know a very specific behaviour, which is to get the delivery tag from the buffer it's responding to, and somehow attach that to its answer. I'd rather there was a callback.\n\nThe library could help you out: maybe something like\n\n``` js\nvar worker = rabbit.socker('WORKER');\nworker.connect('jobs');\nworker.on('data', function(job) {\n  doSomethingAsync(job, worker.lastMessageAcker());\n});\n```\n"

You can't just make queue durable in this case. \nThe reason behind it is that in PubSocket you are not supposed to manage queues at all, here you should use topics instead. \n\nMoreover in rabbit.js while creating SUB socket amqp.node's _assertQueue_ method is used which creates new random queue on each subscribe: \n\n```\nch.assertQueue('', {\n      exclusive: true, autoDelete: true\n  })\n```\n\nwhich can be potentially a leak if you make you queues durable.\n\nSo if you want to have durable queues you also want to specify queue name explicitly, event if it breaks concept PUB/SUB managed by topic. \n\nI'll propose another PR. \n"

In rabbit.js, queues are owned by subscribers, so in effect what you get is that once there are no subscribers, there are no queues, and once there are no queues, the exchange is deleted.\n\nHowever, there's no analogue to those queues for publishers, so there's no way (that I've come up with) for a publisher to prevent an auto-delete exchange from being deleted.

Otherwise, we could have a REQ socket sending its requests into the void with no chance of a reply, even if a REP socket comes along later.\n\nHowever, because REQ sockets _don't_ consume from the queue, there's no way for them to prevent the queue from being deleted.\n"

I'm okay with items down the stream to wait sending an ack until the low water mark catches up. So if you had a prefetch of 100, messages 2-100 were complete but still waiting on message 1 to finish, I'm okay holding 2-100 in the buffer until 1 is acked at which point 2-100 will very quickly be acked as well. Hopefully that made sense.\n"

I could be wrong and incorrectly aligned with this project's goals, so I apologize for that.\n\nWith this in mind, considering [RabbitMQ's management interface (see `/api/exchanges/vhost/name`)](https://cdn.rawgit.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-management/rabbitmq_v3_5_4/priv/www/api/index.html) reveals AMQP's underlying e.g. `durable` option, I would expect it to be presented in rabbit.js.\n\nPerhaps omitting functionality (e.g. options) altogether is less favorable than having them available but with intrinsic defaults. There already exists a hint of this with `routing` being `fanout`.\n\nFrom a beginners perspective, the current socket-like abstractions are useful organizationally speaking, albeit I don't personally use them in a stream context (yet).\n"

RabbitMQ, together with Redis, Crossbar.io and gunicorn-websockets, match pretty well my requirements; however, each of them has a little drawback that I am trying to work around:\n1. RabbitMQ and Redis do not have an Angular/Javascript browser support, so I cannot directly communicate my first app (Angular JS based) with the server;\n   1. crossbar.io and gunicorn-websocket: libraries available for JS and even Angular (WAMP);\n2. RabbitMQ and Redis directly integrate with Django through Celery (2/3 steps configuration process) that is really fast and efficient;\n   1. crossbar.io and gunicorn-websocket: not a so-clear-integration process w/Django;\n   2. there is a project/example to integrate crossbar.io w/Django through Celery, but it is not very mature yet;\n3. crossbar.io and gunicorn-websocket implement WAMP, which is the correct protocol for this application (offers RPC and PUB/SUB, both for clients ant the web);\n   1. RabbitMQ offers STOMP, but you kind of have to run it as a slightly separate server on its own.\n\nAs you may have noticed, I am trying to find the most suitable option and that is why I am asking for clarifications on some of the issues above to understand correctly the actual limits of these options.\n"

It can replace Pusher.com with its realtime push, it's a full-featured database, and to some degree it can work as PUB/SUB, although it's not trying to compete with RabbitMQ.\n\nIn the next release (1-3 months) it will add support for direct connection from browsers, although I'm not sure if they plan any library-specific support on Day 1. However, hooking up RethinkDB -> Node.js + Socket.io -> Angular + Socket.io is very easy, and can be done in an hour or two.\n\nIf you're a fan of ORMs, you can use Angular + JS-Data-Angular -> Node.js + JS-Data-RethinkDB, although that doesn't have a direct support for websockets/push, but can get you up and running with basic filtering in place.\n\nYou could also try https://github.com/mikemintz/rethinkdb-websocket-client - but I have not tried that one.\n\n(And sorry to squaremo if this feels disrespectful to have this discussion on a rabbit.js issue.)\n"

        "body": "Hey Michael,\n\nThanks for getting back to me and sorry for the delay, I've been trying to find the time to work on this around all of my other work. Fun huh.\n\nStill not sure how best to tackle this... At first I thought PUSH/WORKER was the best solution, however now looking at it, it \"may\" be REQ/REP.\n\nUltimately I need a non-blocking way of ensuring that only one recipient processes a message at a time and should that recipient fail, the message needs requeuing to allow another recipient to pick it up.\n\nJust to explain how I've done things so far:\n1. REST Server sends PUSH message to Address 1 to initiate data stream.\n2. DATA Connector receives PUSH message on Address 1 and creates a new data stream.\n3. DATA Connector receives data from data stream and sends PUSH message to Address 2 with data.\n4. QUEUE Processor receives PUSH message on Address 2, processes and acknowledges message.\n\nCurrently 3 won't receive any messages until 1 is acknowledged, however by acknowledging it, should the process fail after acknowledging it, it won't be requeued.\n\nI still think message queuing is the best solution, it's just more how to implement it. \n\nDo you have any suggestions on how best to use RabbitMQ/Rabbit.js to support this, or anything else for that matter?\n\nThanks again\n\nGavin\n"
