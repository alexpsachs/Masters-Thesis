I mean, the sparkline is oft-criticized for being a graph that has statistical problems with it; expecting someone to try to calculate relative sizes of bars sends the wrong message, I think. I'd rather make it about the trending line rather than any absolute numbers.\n\nThanks, by the way. Much appreciated. :)\n"

The maximum input should be set the the 7th element and the minimum input should be set to the 0th element and everything graphed in between - we should be showing as much variation as exists, not whatever the current thing is. I wrote a Haskell script to preprocess the numbers down into a scaled 0-7, and the difference is dramatic:\n\n$ runhaskell scale.hs 50 50 50 51 52 | spark # input: 0.0 0.0 0.0 3.5 7.0\n\u2581\u2581\u2581\u2584\u2587\n$ spark 50 50 50 51 52\n\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\n\nThe latter is almost completely useless. There may be times when that behavior (over-emphasizing the absolute values) makes sense, but I think they are many fewer than when it doesn't make sense - which is most inputs using large numbers and many using small numbers.\n\nThe Haskell script:\n\n``` haskell\nimport System.Environment (getArgs)\n\nmain :: IO ()\nmain = do args <- getArgs\n          let n = map read args :: [Int]\n              mx = maximum n\n              mn = minimum n\n              scale x = fromIntegral (x - mn) * 7 / fromIntegral (mx - mn) :: Double\n              scaled = map scale n\n          putStrLn $ unwords $ map show scaled\n```\n"

Do you know of a decent way to check for that (and then just show `help()` in this case)?\n\nThanks again for your help!\n"

If we were using `read`, there's a time-out option or length option we could use, but as pointed out before, `read` on its own is horrible and needs to be in a complicated loop according to the examples I saw.

        "body": "@rsvp \nThere is no overflow problem.\n\nWhy? Because spark has a resolution of 8. That means, all numbers you fire through spark get scaled within 8.\n\nTherefore, to show anything of meaning, the input numbers must differ significantly when scaled within 8. You won't get any meaning of the fractional part in input like this: 1.2 90 499. The fractional part is just scaled away.\n\nSo using very big numbers together with very small numbers doesn't make sense.\n\nThe purpose of spark is to show relative differences on a scale of 8 and it does that well. There's no need to pull in python (or any other dependency) to do this. It can all be done with bash only and that's all it should need.\n\nIt's very easy to scale your input values (whatever they may be) to get into a meaningful range. That conversion should not be part of spark because converting data is another matter (and probably part of a specific domain).\n\nYou might have heard of the [Unix philosophy](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_philosophy): Write programs that do one thing and do it well. Write programs to work together. ...\n\nPlease respect that spark tries to follow that philosophy.\n\nOne last word about dependencies. Please, do always question them and don't just pull them in blindly. You suspect there's virtually no situation where there is bash but no python. From the top of my mind: A windows box with git bash. Android terminal emulators.\n\nIf you prefer python, that's okay. A fork is nice. But then you should consider using python only and no bash. For the very same reasons. A windows box may have python but no bash.\n"

Then he calls `watch` on the result of `wc -l users.csv` which counts the lines in the file. He continuously appends the result to another `csv` file, and uses `spark` on that one. So, yes, the left part (where he uses `wc -l` to count the lines of `users.csv`) needs to complete first, but that is the intended result.\n\nAnyway, his shell command is not the issue here.
