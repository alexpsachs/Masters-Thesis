        "body": "OK it will be hard to fix that problem properly. \n\nRxjava and activity/fragment lifecycle have been discussed a lot and as far as I know there is no clean solution. \n\nWe can easily prevent the crash by making `RxPermissions` a singleton, so after the rotation change and the user answers to the permission request, the corresponding subject is found. But when the lib emits the response, the observer is still linked to the old activity, so it has no effect to the current new activity.\n\nThe main problem here is we have _rebind_ the subscription in the newly created activity, after the rotation change. This can be done manually by the user, he unsubscribes when the activity dies and resubscribe when the new activity pops. But I don't like that since it adds too much code for the user.\n\nIf someone has a good idea, it would be pleasure to hear.\n"

Then if you rotate the device while the permission popup is displayed, and grant or deny the permission, nothing will happen. This is because the function attached to the `Observable` is linked to the destroyed activity, and it has no effect to the new one.\n\nThe main problem is really to _rebind_ that function from the destroyed activity to the new one. And I'm not even sure it's possible.\n\nThat said, I like the invisible/shadow activity idea, so I'll probably use your PR later, and merge it with my branch.\n"

        "body": "Wow thank you all for taking your time to give help.\n\nAbout making `RxPermissions` survives the activity lifecycle, a simple singleton seems good enough (I tested that in a [branch](https://github.com/tbruyelle/RxPermissions/compare/lifecycle)).\n\nAs @dlew and I said, the main problem is really to _rebind_ the subscription after the death/rebirth of the activity, and I'm more and more convinced this is not possible easily. The main goal of this library is to keep things simple and to provide `Observable`s. So I start to think about trade-offs.\n\nWhen you request a permission, the framework starts a activity called `.permission.ui.GrantPermissionsActivity` (I saw that in logcat), this activity shows a dialog and survives the rotation change. But if it doesn't survive, there is no more issue ! The user will have to re-trigger the permission request, but I don't think this is really embarrassing.\nSo the question is, can I alter that activity's lifecycle, or maybe more plausible ask it to kill itself when I detect the rotation change ?\n\nWDYT ? \n"

Also you are completely right with pointing out that the retriggering of the permission request is the one breaking the flow we want.\n\nAt work we ended up using a `RxAppCompatActivity` exposing an `onPermisssionResultsReceivedObservable()` . So we also broke the `requestPermissions().subscribe()` flow. I really don't think it is possible to keep it without having to `attach/register` and `detach/unregister` the activity on the `RxPermission` instance. \n"

I don't see another easy and reliable way ...\n\nWe could improve that: Instead of having a `RxAppCompatActivity`  as base class we could do something super lazy and add an invisible Fragment (no UI) to get access to `Fragment.onRequestPermissionsResult()` callback (and other lifecycle events if needed). So we could change the api of this library to something like `rxPermissions.with(activity).request(Manifest.permission.CAMERA)` where `withActivity(FragmentActivity)` would attach the invisible fragment or reuse the already attached fragment. I think that would go into the direction @dlew was suggesting (i.e. saving the state into a bundle).\n\nHowever, that would mean that this library would depend on Fragments and FragmentActivity which I really dislike in general.\n"

And if for some rooted devices it's not possible to lock the rotation, the users will have to request the permission twice, this doesn't matter.\nFor other configuration changes, like language change, same thing. I mean, it's not very common that a user changes the language while an app is requesting a permission.\n\nBy explicitly warning the library's users of these trade-offs, I think we can move forward.\n"

Nice. \n\nAbout 3, I have no control on the runtime permission request (other than create a new one), I can't cancel or resume it. The permission request is resumed automatically after a configuration change. \n\n#### Anyway, a solution begins to take shape :\n1. **a permission request is triggered** : `RxPermissions` registers a subject associated with that permission and requests the framework : the runtime permission popup appears.\n2. **a configuration change occurs** : `RxPermissions` unsubscribes all registered subjects, but keeps in memory the pending requests. It will survive the configuration change because it's a singleton since 0.2.0.\n   The runtime permissions popup is paused and will be resumed automatically.\n3. **the app restarts** : The permission request is redone by the app (this is actually the only requirement, but as @dlew said it's a logical outcome), `RxPermissions` _remembers_ a pending request has been done for this permission, and registers a new subject for it, **but** doesn't request the framework a second time (otherwise the result would be another runtime permissions popup).\n   The runtime permissions popup is resumed and displayed again.\n4. **user answers to the permission request** : `RxPermissions.onRequestPermissionsResult` is invoked, the lib finds the corresponding subject and emits the user response. \n\nThat sounds not bad...\n"

Currently it's impossible to use composition over inheritance for fragments and activities. I saw/build many libs requiring the user to call a delegate in ~10 lifecycle methods to make them work or extend their `LibXyzActivity`. There was a `RxFragment` earlier in RxAndroid (not forwarding all lifecycle events and NonConfigurationInstance was missing) which could be a start. Personally I would build it without Rx in the first step to make it universal usable.\n\nWith a `ComposableActivity` we could write plugins which could be used to bind multiple libs logic to activities.\n\nLibs that could profit from this:\n- [mosby](https://github.com/sockeqwe/mosby) @sockeqwe \n- [flow](https://github.com/square/flow/) @loganj\n- [compartment](https://github.com/grandstaish/compartment) @grandstaish \n- AppCompat :P not really but they are using a delegate too [AppCompatPreferenceActivity source](https://android.googlesource.com/platform/development/+/master/samples/Support7Demos/src/com/example/android/supportv7/app/AppCompatPreferenceActivity.java)\n- two internal libs from me\n- many others\n\nThis looks like a solution but is not maintained: https://github.com/BoD/android-activitylifecyclecallbacks-compat\n"

So one can do things like\n\n```\nRxLocation.get(restartHandler).subscribe(v -> {})\n```\n\nAnd get a flow that first asks for location, then asks for gps enabled, then gets a location and returns it. Safe from activity restarts/rotations halfway through.\n\nWe would have made this a PR, but it's an entirely different approach. With it's own pro's and con's. (Pro's being it'll always work, con being it's more work to support it. Chances are some users would be happy to cover the 95% case). However we'll be using this solution to solve other problems as well. For example getting a picture from the gallery, where your app is fairly likely to be dumped from memory halfway through the process.\n"

I would appreciate if some of you review it.\n\nThe fix removes some flexibility to the lib but I didn't find anything better.\n\nThe good news is for clients who request the permission during activity/fragment/view start, nothing change, it will  work as these.\nFor client who request the permission after a particular event, there is some breaking changes :\n- Firstly, they need to move the request call in one of the activity/fragment/view start method.\n- Secondly, they need to add an extra parameter to the `request` or `requestEach` method : an `Observable` that represents that particular event. See the PR for details.\n\nExample from the sample app, the click event is transformed to an observable with `RxBinding` :\n\n``` java\n    @Override\n    protected void onCreate(Bundle savedInstanceState) {\n        super.onCreate(savedInstanceState);\n\n        setContentView(R.layout.act_main);\n\n         // com.jakewharton.rxbinding.view.RxView is perfect to represent the event needed\n        Observable<Object> trigger = RxView.clicks(findViewById(R.id.enableCamera));\n\n         RxPermissions.getInstance(this)\n                .request(trigger, Manifest.permission.CAMERA)\n                .subscribe(granted -> {\n```\n"

We have an app with 100+ views (using views instead of fragments as well), and having all of our permission related code in the single activity onCreate isn't really an option. It is considerably easier for those where that is an option though.\n\nFor just glancing at the code, I'm guessing your using the permission itself as an identifier for the request? That means you can only request a permission from one place in the app. If you want the camera permission in 3 different places your gonna need another identifier.\n"

That means you can only request a permission from one place in the app. If you want the camera permission in 3 different places your gonna need another identifier.\n\nI think it should work. From the beginning the lib has been designed with concurrent access in focus. For instance, if there's 3 camera permission requests from 3 different places, the same observable is returned to the subscribers. So when the user's answer is caught, all subscribers will receive it. \n\nThat said, if the requests are done very simultaneously, it won't work as expected since I forgot to use `synchronized`... That's another small improvement.\n"

That.. is a better solution.\n\nI had a look at it, and overall it looks fine, but since the singleton is a static referanse and you never remove anything from mSubjects it'll leak. I dont see any other choice here but to remove from that on unsubscribe and require clients to implement that. (Or hold a weak ref to subscribers, but that'll require the activity to hold an active referance to it or be GC'd. Cant be an inner referance).\n\nSince this is a better approach I'd like to extend this to support onActivityResult as well. Making a seperate issue for that though to keep this on task. See #15 \n"

Then you could make the observable a field, and in onClick trigger a .subscribe. Then you dont need RxView for anything.\n\nI can't decide if I like this or not, but since I can't decide I figured I'd mention it and you can think it over as well :p. I think it might be better at dealing with special cases, for example if you want to immediately start showing a spinner, then request permission or something like that.\n"

I removed it here 2455bcf21d5ac9adc82e6f89786d6de2a085b89c but now I have to fix the `request` method which doesn't work any more. \n\nIndeed, `take(1)` was here to ensure the sequence was completed, this is mandatory because `request` use `toList()` to transform the original sequence to a single boolean (`toList()` requires completed sequence or else it emits nothing).\n\nI have an idea of the final fix, I'll publish it today.\n"

If `Build.VERSION.SDK_INT < 23`, the observer will immediately receive a granted result.\n\nSecondly, it seems you're not well informed about runtime permissions. Only a  part of the permissions requires a request : the dangerous ones, as Google names them [1]. \n\nAbout the crash itself, I think it's exactly because you request permissions that don't need to be requested. Try to filter the parameter list with only _dangerous_ permissions and it should work.\n\nThat said you pointed a weakness in the library that needs a fix.

Indeed currently it's possible to write the following code : \n\n``` java\nbtn.setOnClickListener(v -> RxPermissions.getInstance(this).request(perm).subscribe( { ... ] )\n```\n\nBut that code doesn't handle configuration change during permission request. So by exposing only _composable_ methods, I make this impossible. What do you think ?\n\nI still have other checks to do but this sounds very promising.\n"

The proof is `ShadowActivity.onDestroy` isn't invoked from the framework in that second case. Without that call, `RxPermissions` isn't able to remind previous permission requests, causing the issue you created.\n\nDo you know why in that case the android lifecycle is ignored ?\n"

When I changed the part of request_() method (lines 193-205) to the following, the bug stopped to appear:\n\n```\nPublishSubject<Permission> subject = mSubjects.get(permission);\n            // Request the permission to the framework only if not already done\n            // and if there's no request without result (occurs on configuration\n            // change, see onDestroy method).\n            if (subject == null) {                                           // sic!\n                unrequestedPermissions.add(permission);\n            }\n\n            // Create a new subject if not exists\n            if (subject == null || subject.hasCompleted()) {    // sic!\n                subject = PublishSubject.create();\n                mSubjects.put(permission, subject);\n            }\n```\n\nThis is actually how it was in one of the previous versions (to be precise, before the commit e205f9dd5669073731b2deed293fcc02ecee69d3).

Too bad we can't rely on `onDestroy`, since this is the only method in the lifecycle where it is certain that `onCreate` will be invoked on back. With `onStop`, it can be `onCreate` or `onStart`, it depends... Android lifecycle is really a fucking disaster, so tired of fighting against it for years...\n\nI try to find an other fix.\n"

At this time without your fix, I agree the app crashes. With your fix there's no crash but there's also no emission of the response to the subscriber, as you mentionned it.\n\nSo sorry but I'm not going to merge that PR, I prefer a visible crash than a ghost partial fix.\n"

User removes our app from recent apps, while permission request is in process.\n2. User reopens our app - we restore pending permissions subjects.\n3. But actually Android System won't restore ShadowActivity.\n4. We end up thinking that we ARE requesting some permissions while we are NOT.\n\nThat causes lot of bugs - i. e.:\nAll subsequent requests of that permissions won't do anything, because we think that we are already requesting them - so we should not start ShadowActivity.\n\nWe could handle described situation only if we know whether user closed our app, or system closed our app. But as far as I know Android doesn't provide us with this kind of information.\n"

However, according to the conception of Safe-driven development, it's a good decision to hide all crashes in production, keeping them in development builds. So, it may be better that nothing.\n\nThe problem with this crash is that it happens in library's insides, so we get no chance to even wrap it in try-catch until the solution will be found. The single option is to fork the library and add it as a third-party project.\nMaybe we can add a log or non-fatal report instead of a strict crash there? Thus library's safety will be improved with killing two birds -- we'll have a marker of the issue to further return to it (as we already know the steps), and we'll protect users from facing crashes in production.\n"

But it crashes sometimes giving permission error only.\nMoreover while the permission box is there is shows the 'else' case snackbar too \"Permission Denied\".\n\nPlease let me know if I'm doing something wrong, or my implementation is wrong or something as its not working everytime. Sometimes (if I stay at dialog permission dialog for few seconds) in the Log on even allowing it give false (CommonUtils log) and after that screen overlay detected go to settings. Strange behavior is happening.  \n\nAlso I would like to know once the user has granted the permission still the code under 'if' at line  25 will be executed everytime?\n"

This method returns true if the app has requested this permission previously and the user denied the request.\n> \n> Note: If the user turned down the permission request in the past and chose the Don't ask again option in the permission request system dialog, this method returns false. The method also returns false if a device policy prohibits the app from having that permission.\n\nSo in your case, the first time the user denied the request, the method should return true. Unless you have a device policy which prohibits the app from having the camera permission, or unless there's something wrong in your implementation (but didn't find what).\n\nOther thing, I think you should check if permission is granted first, because in that case it's possible that `shouldShowRequestPermissionRationale` returns false.\n"

Also, I'm triggering the permissions request from an event, and  I can't easily make the element reactive.  I ran into this exception as I was experimenting with how RxPermissions would handle the permissions request in this case.  \n\nI read through https://github.com/tbruyelle/RxPermissions/issues/3, and I think that the tradeoff of flexibility (requiring the permissions request in the initialization) for completeness is perfectly reasonable, for cases where you need to guarantee that the result is emitted to the subscriber.  However, it would also seem reasonable for the library to support cases where it doesn't matter if the occasional request gets dropped.  At least, I didn't expect the library to crash.  I also have no way to catch the exception and act on it, since it's thrown completely internally to the library.  Is there a way to emit the error to the observable?  \n"

Fixes #44.\n\nThe benefit of `setRetainInstance(true);` is that the fragment will live along with the activity even after rotation, so once the activity is recreated the fragment still alive and re-attached to the new activity, so no more rotation issues. Without this the fragment dies along with the activity and the permission request process is lost. Also since `RxPermissions` is a singleton with a fragment reference it should refer the same fragment a no a new one to avoid memory leaks and unexpected behaviors.\n"

At least that's how I feel about them. I try to avoid them as much as I can.\r\n\r\nI agree that fragments behave oddly sometimes, but it's due his async nature, actually I try to avoid them too, but the way we are using them here is forcing the fragment to be sync on setup time, so we shouldn't worry about this from my point of view.\r\n\r\n> Also this 'hack' of a transparent activity is quite common, no?

If you dont want your listeners being invoked twice or more, you MUST unsubscrbe from them in, for instance, `onDestroy()` activity callback.\r\n\r\nIn your current realization I have seen that you're subscribing to different observables, giving references to your UI elements and activity. But, as you probably know, after screen roation, activity destroys and recreates. And in your realization it couldn't be destroyed, cause your have references to activity in RxJavaEnviroment. So after rotation you have 1 activity in memory and another one that rectreates. \r\nAnd all callbacks such as `onCreate(...), onStart() etc` are called again. And you again subscribe to all rx stuff and give away references to new Activity )))\r\nSo you have now 2 (or more, depend of how many times you rotate phone) references to your activity after screen rotation and memory leak =)) lol =)\r\n\r\nHow to fix:\r\nadd all `Subscriptions` to `CompositeSubscription` and in some Activity's callback like `(onPause())` call `compositeSubscription.clear()`. Those magic things unsubscribe all your listeners and avoid memory leaks and multiple _firing_ of `subscribe()` method \r\n\r\nPS your listeners will show 2 toast cause you listen same things in different places. So you have something task like below :\r\nI want `doSomeWork()` being called if(and when) 1st **OR** 2nd buttons get  permission allowed in `onSubscribe` \r\nBut you do `doSomeWork()` when 1st button get event **AND** when 2nd get. You share this event between 2 subscribers, you know, and nothing strange didn't happen. You received it and display 2 times in general.\r\nYou should use Combined observables in this case. Read [here](https://github.com/ReactiveX/RxJava/wiki/Combining-Observables), pls  \r\n\r\n "

No-o, not for me. \r\nI don't see the problem in recreating activity while orientation change. Just subscribe RxPermition in `onStart()`, unsubscribe chain in `onStop()`, and you're good to go, aren't you ? Permission dialog will be showed again. No problems\r\n\r\nAnd thigs, that you do in your example, not so obvious for me ...\r\n\r\n\r\n"

And as @trueangle said, I tried adding some codes in the RxPermissions class as below:\r\n```java\r\n    public RxPermissions(@NonNull Fragment fragment) {\r\n        mRxPermissionsFragment = getRxPermissionsFragment(fragment);\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    private RxPermissionsFragment getRxPermissionsFragment(Fragment fragment) {\r\n        RxPermissionsFragment rxPermissionsFragment = findRxPermissionsFragment(fragment);\r\n        boolean isNewInstance = rxPermissionsFragment == null;\r\n        if (isNewInstance) {\r\n            rxPermissionsFragment = new RxPermissionsFragment();\r\n            FragmentManager fragmentManager = fragment.getChildFragmentManager();\r\n            fragmentManager\r\n                    .beginTransaction()\r\n                    .add(rxPermissionsFragment, TAG)\r\n                    .commitAllowingStateLoss();\r\n            fragmentManager.executePendingTransactions();\r\n        }\r\n        return rxPermissionsFragment;\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    private RxPermissionsFragment findRxPermissionsFragment(Fragment fragment) {\r\n        return (RxPermissionsFragment) fragment.getChildFragmentManager().findFragmentByTag(TAG);\r\n    }\r\n```\r\nAnd it works like a charm. However getChildFragmentManager() isn't supported before API 17, also I'm not sure whether this handling meets your expectations.\r\nIf you could accept this or provide any better solutions, it'll be great appreciated since I really need it in my project.\r\n\r\nBest,"

He sees \"contacts\", and not \"READ_CONTACTS\" , \"WRITE_CONTACTS\".

        "body": "This is **not** reproducible with the standard android api Activity, as Activity has a flag to check if there is a pending permission request\r\nFrom Activity.java API 26 `requestPermissions()`:\r\n```\r\nIntent intent = getPackageManager().buildRequestPermissionsIntent(permissions);\r\nstartActivityForResult(REQUEST_PERMISSIONS_WHO_PREFIX, intent, requestCode, null);\r\nmHasCurrentPermissionsRequest = true;\r\n```\r\n\r\nIt **is** reproducible, however, if you request permission with the framework Fragment API (instead of the Activity one). Which is what this lib does.\r\n```\r\nimport android.app.Fragment;\r\nRxPermissionsFragment extends Fragment\r\n```\r\n\r\nFrom Activity.java API 26 - surprise! no checks for the case with Fragment:\r\n```\r\n@Override\r\npublic void onRequestPermissionsFromFragment(Fragment fragment, String[] permissions,\r\n                int requestCode) {\r\n        String who = REQUEST_PERMISSIONS_WHO_PREFIX + fragment.mWho;\r\n        Intent intent = getPackageManager().buildRequestPermissionsIntent(permissions);\r\n        startActivityForResult(who, intent, requestCode, null);\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nAs a bottomline, the bug is kinda both in the lib and in the Android framework. RxPermissions is a pretty nice thing which I enjoy, but it always appears to be a bit undertested against \"Do not keep activities\" :)\r\n\r\nBy the way, the problem seems to be fixed for the support lib Fragment. Which might be an easy solution for the lib. The drawback is that it will require the calling activity to extend AppCompatActivity (which is, in my opinion, what it should be doing anyway - and this bug is a nice example of _why_...)\r\nAnother solution might be just to add a flag before requesting permission, just like in the Activity class."

Maybe it called after onDestroy() or something like that ??? \r\nThen about crash log. It clearly describe what had been happened (but not clearly **why exactly**) with **java.lang.UnsatisfiedLinkError.**\r\nIt is key for problem solving. As I remember this error appears in most cases when your code  couldn't find path to JNI lib classes. Or when JNI lib couldn't be loaded. Try to google about **java.lang.UnsatisfiedLinkError** \r\nDoes your app use some native libs ???\r\n\r\nAlso you could start from [here](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/lang/UnsatisfiedLinkError.html) and maybe [here](https://examples.javacodegeeks.com/java-basics/exceptions/java-lang-unsatisfiedlinkerror-how-to-handle-unsatisfied-link-error/)\r\n\r\nAnd one more suggestion. This case is more for stackoverflow community. Here you wouldn't get help much as you could get there. Keep this in mind. \r\nKeep calm and good luck!\r\n\r\n"

        "body": "@coolBreezes This was a design change, with the old api `RxPermissions.getInstance(this)` we used to have a singleton static instance of `RxPermissions` with a linked `Application` context instance(the one passed by `this`.`getApplicationContext()`). This context was used to start a ghost activity for requesting permissions(a workaround to be less invasive for library user's apps). Then we opted to use a retained fragment to manage the permissions and get rid of the ghost activity and improve the UX without that ghost activity. This is pretty much the reason behind this api change, since we cannot longer manage a singleton instance, we let the library user's create/inject a singleton of `RxPermissions` with an `@ActivityScope` for example with Dagger. I hope I had answered your questions."

The only thing you should keep in mind it's `dispose` your subscription to RxPermission observable in `onStop` (actiually we dispose all of our subscribtions in `onStop`). And you're good to go. Nothing bad should happen, because views won't be touched. And you shouldn't ever get  `java.lang.IllegalStateException: Can not perform this action after onSaveInstanceState` as we totally forgot about it. At all.\r\nVery quick example of what I'm talking about could be found [here](https://gist.github.com/mrArtCore/032628dd99d007b06299e0347c8c9db4)"

See [compose]( http://reactivex.io/RxJava/javadoc/io/reactivex/Observable.html#compose-io.reactivex.ObservableTransformer- ) function javadoc for details.\r\n\r\nI understand this like if you just want to request permission as independent action, e.g. when screen created, you're going to create Rx chain and `request` permissions, you know, with `RxPermission.request(..params)`. But when you want to request permisssions only when button was clicked (like in README example) you could add it in Rx chain of button click events with `.compose(ensure(Permission.NAME))`"

Use that exact mContext and pass it to new instance of RxPermissions instead of \"this\". Compile error should be gone. \r\n\r\np.s. please read documentation before you post similar \"issues\". Probably this was more for [Stackoverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/rxpermissions). Adding more tickets like this makes, life of maintainers more difficult and real project issues can be lost in a noise of non important tickets. \r\n"
