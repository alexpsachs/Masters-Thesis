I've opened a bug with 10gen: https://jira.mongodb.org/browse/RUBY-547\n\nIn the meanwhile, you can use `?slaveOk=true` in your connection strings. If you connect directly to a secondary, that will make the client not give that error, and if you connect to the replica set as a whole, that sets a \"secondary-preferred\" read preference, meaning it will try to read from a secondary if one is available.\n\nI'll update the docs.\n"

As your example shows, either one can be viewed as an extension of the current format, since the current format overloads the key to mean both source and destination. I think I like using the destination as the key, since it feels like you're more-clearly describing how to build up a SQL table from the Mongo collection, rather than vice-versa.\n\nIt also allows for more extensibility going forward -- you could support mapping the same mongo key to multiple places in SQL, or you could support `:source: [some expression syntax]`, to support doing more-complex transformations at import time. Both feel more natural in the \"current new\" syntax.\n"

There are a bunch of tricky questions I don't have good answers, too, though, such as what to use for unique IDs on the unrolled tables, and how you manage updates -- we don't actually see, e.g. `$pop` operations as such in the oplog, we just see a `$set` of the entire array. Do you have to in general do a diff of some sort against the existing array to figure out what updates to perform?\n\nI haven't had time to give this a ton of thought, and I think there may not be perfectly clean answers to all of these questions, but I'd be open to something workable if someone has the time to think about it harder.\n"

I've pushed a commit to the pr-15 branch that contains a test case demonstrating the problem.\n\nIf you wanted to, I'd love to remove the implicit `_id` assumption and make this work, but as a stop-gap, I'd also just merge a version that adds an assertion that `_id` is not renamed, with the plan of improving the situation later.\n"

I've been pretty busy during the last weeks.\n\nI have to admit my example wasn't really clear, plus it contained some code taken from my actual callbacks which I forgot to remove/rename. Let me explain what I'm using mosql for, this should hopefully make everything clear.\n\nWe have a big database running inside of MongoDB and we want to move its contents to PostgreSQL. While doing that we want to:\n- get rid of MongoDB's `ObjectId`s and use standard sql ids.\n- unwind the associations between our collections. Our previous code used [Mongoid](http://mongoid.org/), now we are migrating to Active Record. Some of these relations are simple _\"has one/belongs to\"_, but we have also a _\"has and belongs to many\"_.\n\nSo we defined our PostgreSQL schema inside of Rails using a set of migrations and then we created mosql's `collections.yml` file. Some columns and tables are hidden to mosql (like the join table for the _habtm_ association and the foreign keys used by the _\"belongs to\"_ relations).\n\nThe columns/tables not visible from mosql are populated on the fly by custom callbacks. That's why the callback methods receive the whole object as read from MongoDB.\n\nI recognize this is a really specific (and strange) usage of mosql. I hope this comment makes everything clear.\n\nDo you think my example (cleaned up and improved a little bit) could be useful?\n"

        "body": "Hi Matthew,\n\nDo you have logs from the MoSQL import? Are there any lines at WARN priority? (you can just grep for `WARN`). At the moment, if MoSQL encounters records that don't match the declared schema, it will ignore them and issue a WARN-level log statement.\n\nThe duplicate inserts are harmless -- MoSQL implements \"upsert\" by doing an `INSERT` and catching the duplicate-key exception and doing an `UPDATE` instead. I actually just pushed a change today that reworks this logic to avoid the exceptions in the Postgres logs, since they're noisy and worrying if you don't know to expect them.\n"

        "body": "Hrm. Sorry, I've been busy and kinda procrastinating. Thinking about this some more, I think the right way to get this kind of extensibility might be, instead of adding a weird hook to load code, to do some slight refactoring to make it possible to pull in `MoSQL` as a library, and then call methods to inject yourself into the stream process. That would be even more flexible than the proposed approach, and would let you manage the hook code and versioning and all that just as another rubygem, which would be better, operationally. If that sounds acceptable, I'd be happy to do that work and throw up an example of using it to get the functionality demonstrated in the examples so far.\n"

Won't this result in not getting any logging output, since we don't currently have a way to configure a logfile, and `Process.daemon` redirects output to `/dev/null`.\n\nMy recommended way of deploying MoSQL would be to use a process supervisor that monitors your processes as children, and manages redirecting stdout/stderr to a logfile for you. This allows all the logic of logging and daemonization and management to live in one standard tool, without requiring every utility to know how to manage it separately.\n\nSome common process supervisors that support this mode of operation are [supervisord](http://supervisord.org/), [daemontools](http://cr.yp.to/daemontools.html), [upstart](http://upstart.ubuntu.com/), and [systemd](http://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/Software/systemd/).\n"

An insert appends to that set (if the record already exists), and a delete removes; If the set ever becomes empty, you can delete the record.\n\nOne option is to, on delete, consul the `mongoc` _possibly by way of the `mongos`' APIs) to determine whether the shard that's being deleted from is the canonical location of the record, and ignore the delete if not. This has some problems where the `mongoc` represents the *current_ mapping, but you're tailing the oplog potentially some distance in the past, and it's possible there have been additional `mongoc` updates since then.\n\nOne option is to hope that the oplog contains enough information to detect this situation directly. I haven't looked into whether that's true. Even if it is you need to handle the case where `mosql` exits mid-migration, so that on resumption it won't see the past -- i.e. you'll need to reflect all state into the database table `mosql` uses to store its state.\n\nI think that's basically all the ideas I've had.

For environments with mostly updates, this change doesn't affect performance. For environments where large inserts are common, however, this change makes a huge difference.\n\nIf anybody is interested, I can clean it up and put together some tests for merging.\n"

You can pass `--no-drop-tables` to inhibit the dropping behavior, if necessary.\n\nIt will still print \"Creating table\", but with `--no-drop-tables` what that actually indicates is just that it's checking for existence and has found the table.\n\nMoSQL's `-v` option does not take a verbosity level; Try `-v -v -v` to get more debug output, and hopefully that will reveal more detail. I suspect that the problem may be on your postgres server in some form -- can you check whether the query is hanging on that end?\n"

        "body": "In our case it was because mosql was unable to process and store the data fast enough so it slowly falls behind. Once it's trying to process data older than the oplog has available you get this error I believe. One option might be to increase the oplog size if it's some temporary high traffic condition that could be recovered from after the storm is over. Other than that I imagine it's mostly about scaling up the mosql server and/or postgres. The only way to scale mosql out I think would be to split up each collection's processing into a seperate mosql process. There are no options for parallelizing the processing otherwise I don't believe thought I'd love for someone maintaining the project to verify.\n"

We ended up increasing the opslog size for the secondaries so we'll see how much benefit that gives us. The other problem was connecting to the secondaries though readPreference. For some reason that seems to fail a lot. Instead, we point directly to the secondaries and use slaveOk. Cross fingers, will see if that holds up. \n"

That worked fine i.e. read from secondary. \nNext I went deeper into the MoSQL code. Things are as expected until the function `initial_import` is called in `streamer.rb`. Before the line \n`collections = db.collections.select { |c| spec.key?(c.name) }`\nclient instance is secondary (checked config via `@mongo['admin'].command(:ismaster => 1)` ).

        "body": "Update on the issue. This is what we found out:\n\nThe `db.collections` command results in a `listCollections` call. This command is only allowed to be run on the primary. So the mongo driver routes this command to the primary. This happens in both old and the new drivers. However on `1.12.3` the driver continues to be struck to the primary and reads from there.\nFor the `1.12.x` drivers: if no `listCollections` or similar commands are executed on the connection before making a read query, the driver correctly reads from the secondary.\n\nSo it would seem to be a mongo driver issue. This issue has been fixed in the latest versions. So I see 2 ways to resolve this:\na) update mosql to use latest drivers\nb) use an older driver with mosql (unfortunately not an option if using Mongo3.0 as 1.12 is the earliest driver supporting 3.0)\n"
