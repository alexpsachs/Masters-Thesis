Perhaps:\n- require() \n- add() (for merely adding to localStorage if not present, with perhaps an optional switch to overwrite if it is)\n- remove()\n- wait()\n\nwould cover all our needs. \n\nIn terms of @nimbupani's comments regarding localStorage usage here, I have to say that I'm personally still on the fence about this approach. I've read Google, Bing and Facebook engineers say that there are definitely performance benefits to storing scripts in this manner (despite localStorage not (at least in my view) having been created for this purpose). What I would like this project to do is:\n- Give developers a reference point if they do want to add localStorage script caching to their app\n- Provide public benchmarks that demonstrate whether there is any validity to using localStorage for this at all. To date, I still haven't personally seen any beyond what's been told to me and I think its needed if this idea is to have legs.\n\n+1 to @mahemoff. This is really just a hack until the alternatives improve.\n"

        "body": "Thanks for putting this together!. \n\nI agree that this project really needs some performance testing to validate whether there are benefits to using localStorage for caching. I think there are a few different facets to benchmarking we need to consider though: there's localStorage vs alterative 'modern' storage formats and localStorage vs browser caching (which is the major thing we need to cover).\n\nMore random thoughts..\n\nFrom what research I've done IDB _is_ slower than localStorage at the moment (as partially confirmed by the above), but I wonder if some of the problem is that there's much confusion about which storage options should be used for particular use cases.\n\nFor offline, there are three problems, and three solutions :\n- Application => cache manifest\n- Configuration => localStorage\n- Data => IndexedDB, file system (File API)\n\nFor our particular needs, maybe we _should_ be using IDB, but the problem there is it's direly slow. Does that mean we should be looking at the File API compared to localStorage instead? Libraries like https://github.com/ebidel/filer.js could help with that, but the issue is that even if we did use the most optimal solution we'd have to implement it in a tiered way.\n\nie. \n\nIf ( fileAPI ) => use\nelse ( IndexedDB )\nelse ( localStorage )\netc.\n\nThat could get complicated fairly quickly. Part of me really wants to stick with localStorage for now and I think Jen's comments (lower down) here sum up why fairly well: http://hacks.mozilla.org/2012/03/there-is-no-simple-solution-for-local-storage/comment-page-1/\n\nThat said..lets continue with the perf testing front. More data to confirm a best path forward either way cant be a bad thing :)\n"

When a the version is changed, it will remove the old one, and add in this (like overwrite). This is similar to overwrite, but with one big difference, I don't have to think about the last version used. With overwrite, you need to remember if you have to overwrite, this can cause subtle bugs when forgotten. A better name for it would probably be something like `id` or `hash`. I think this can actually replace overwrite, since you can just change the version to get the same effect.\n\n@addyosmani Thoughts?\n"

We should be careful about having sugar that doesn't really save that much typing and it gives the user multiple ways to do one thing.\n\nThe point of having a powerful .require method is that they can do all the loading in one method. If we introduce the .add sugar. User will start to do this:\n\n``` javascript\nbasket.add({\n    url: 'http://website.com/foo.js',\n    key: 'foo.js',\n    hash: '123'\n}).require({\n    url: 'http://website.com/foo2.js',\n    key: 'foo2.js',\n    hash: '123'\n});\n```\n\nWhen this, in my opinion, looks better:\n\n``` javascript\nbasket.require({\n    url: 'http://website.com/foo.js',\n    key: 'foo.js',\n    hash: '123',\n    execute: false\n},{\n    url: 'http://website.com/foo2.js',\n    key: 'foo2.js',\n    hash: '123'\n});\n```\n\nI'm a -0 on this.\n"

Some background info: when I created the first version of basket, I purposefully left out support for CSS loading of assets as this was something deemed inappropriate for localStorage caching by a few members of the community. This was in part because we want to avoid any FOUT but also, once you move beyond scripts you begin to get into AppCache territory (which arguably is better suited to CSS).\n\nI won't close this immediately, but it would be useful to hear what @peol and @sindresorhus think.\n"

We should definitely consider having an opt-in for it, or even by default.\n\n@peol I don't see the issue. Does it really matter if the cached asset is dropped to early? It will just be refetched from the server. You can't rely on it being in localStorage anyway. What if the user wipes it themselves?\n\nThe nice thing about the automatic trasher is that it will allow for new entries to take priority instead of old (and maybe even obsolete) entries. An even better use case is if the user doesn't use TTL. Then the asset would live in localStorage forever, and block new entries, but with the automatic space saving, it would be trashed when the space was needed (we would add a timeStamp on when every entry was added to localStorage).\n"

The FT and one or two other large sites have been investing time in this area, so who knows? We might able to get some decent feedback when the next version is ready :)\n\nWhilst this thread is probably not the best place for a discussion about this, I think we'll need to discuss our long-term goals for this project. It very much began as an experiment and as it evolves we'll need to decide what is left to make it truly production-ready (with a few case studies of people using it in practice etc).\n"

We currently have most of them mentioned across issues.\n\nThat can give us a starting point to defend the position that localStorage can be used for files and there are browsers where this is relatively not expensive. \n"

        "body": "Hi guys!\n\nMight I give you some suggestions for the future...\n\nLet me first explain my situation for background info. I'm trying to develop a mobile hybrid application with Apache Cordova at the moment and I'm keeping some of my library javascripts (Backbone, jQuery, etc) in local folder and some application specific files (models, views) I'm loading from the web because I wan't to be able to develop them without going through the hard app store deployment processes for every supported platform all the time.\n\nCurrently I'm also using require.js to load those files and it means I need to make close to 20 http request every time I start the application just to get those models and views. What I'd like to do, is to store those models ans views locally (in localStorage) to be able to avoid unnecessary http requests when I know views and models have not been changed. Also, I'd like my app to start even without web connection and that is a problem for pure require.js too.\n\nSo I'm asking, since asynchronous module loading (and require.js) seem to be quite a hot topic nowadays, have you considered some kind of integration of basket.js with require.js. Could basket.js become a plugin for require.js or something?\n\nBr, Tomi\n"

According to http://jsperf.com/basket-js-versus-browser-cache, the browser cache is much, much faster than basket.js on FF 17, Chrome 23 and Canary 25.\n\nGiven that raw localStorage appeared to be faster I checked by adding a breakpoint in Chrome developer tools that the getUrl function is never called. It seems likely that the bottleneck is creating the script tag and adding it to the DOM, though I haven't proven that.\n\nThis was basket.js 0.2 from the website rather than the latest version in git, but I can see no reason why the newer version would be faster.\n"

We should update the `Why localStorage` to summary reflect the article.\n"

        "body": "The problem of 404s being saved into the cache, and of not being able to detect a failure, are both solved by the promises implementation.\n\nIt also gives the user more control over what happens when things go wrong. You could do:\n\n``` javascript\n// We absolutely definitely need jquery in order to display properly\nbasket.require({ url: 'jquery.js' })\n    .then(function() {\n        // But lets say that without the bootstrap js we can degrade gracefully if we know it\n        basket.require({ url: 'bootstrap.js' })\n            .then(siteWithBootstrap, siteWithoutBootstrap);\n    });\n```\n\nHowever, looking at the current logic I'm not quite happy that I got it right.\n\nCurrently, if you do\n\n``` javascript\nbasket.require({\n    { url: 'jquery.js' },\n    { url: 'doesntexist123.js' },\n    { url: 'plugin.js' },\n    { url: 'alsomissing.js' }\n}).then(successHandler, errorHandler);\n```\n\nthen jquery.js and plugin.js will be executed, but only the errorHandler will be called, and only once (for whichever failed first).\n\nAt the moment you can also do\n\n``` javascript\nbasket.require({ url: 'doesntexist123.js' });\nbasket.require({ url: 'jquery.js' })\n   .then(doStuff);\n```\n\nDue to the way it is written the promise returned from the second require encompasses both files, so doStuff wouldn't be called even if jquery loads - this is probably a bug. Seperate require calls shouldn't rely on each other.\n\nI guess what we really want is:\n- The errorhandler should be called with details of all failures\n- The detail passed back should be specced out. At the moment it is an Error object with the message just being xhr.statusText\n- Scripts shouldn't be executed unless everything in a particular require() call succeeds. If you require 4 files at the moment, and get an error, you can't really tell what has run and what hasn't.\n"

There are some very very minor tid bits like the version of jQuery we reference in our examples being out of date, but we can live with that.

        "body": "The wait() method there is also like the old basket.js wait() or the new then() in that it accepts a callback.\n\nBecause in the LABjs style interface you can do require().require(), require().wait() and require().then(), the require method would still have to return a promise with the extra methods added. And the require() method on the promise would need to be basically the same as the thenRequire method we already have, I think.\n\nHmm, actually the LABjs thing is slightly different. With thenRequire, as it stands, the later scripts don't even download until the first require is completed. With LABjs it begins fetching all scripts immediately, but _executes_ them in the given order. That could make your page loads a fair bit faster.\n\nSo, IMO, the thenRequire interface is tidier and easier to implement for the same end, but starting the fetch early is a very good feature we should borrow. Renaming thenRequire to just be require might make the interface feel simpler, too.\n\nSomething like\n\n``` javascript\nbasket.require({url \"jquery.js\" }, {url: \"backbone.js\" })\n    .require({ url: \"jquery-ui.js\" });\n```\n\nwould download all three scripts in parallel, but jquery-ui would not be executed until jquery and backbone had been.\n"

If thats the case then a tool that automatically generates and manages a manifest file for you can do the same without the performance hit..\n\nor is localstorage actually faster than appcache, thus compensating for additional load/parse/execution overhead?\n\nalso, images/css - basket js could do these too? Unless theres limitations on the localstorage (eg where a lot of image data could exceed the limit) - in which case you would use appcache, and since you're using it for images you may as well use it for scripts and css - unless there's any significant benefit to loading scripts into localstorage as a seperate affair?\n"

        "body": "> is it a case of trading off performance with simplicty that basket.js provides? If thats the case then a tool that automatically generates and manages a manifest file for you can do the same without the performance hit..\n\nSimplicity yes, and being able to define and load dependencies programmatically, instead of having to define a manifest upfront.\n\nWe've tried automagic generation of appcache manifest in yeoman, and I didn't really like it, since it will never know all your resources. (more discussion about that here https://github.com/yeoman/yeoman/issues/762).\n\n> or is localstorage actually faster than appcache, thus compensating for additional load/parse/execution overhead?\n\nDunno, I would guess no, but we should make some perf tests prove it either way.\n\n> also, images/css - basket js could do these too? Unless theres limitations on the localstorage (eg where a lot of image data could exceed the limit) - in which case you would use appcache, and since you're using it for images you may as well use it for scripts and css - unless there's any significant benefit to loading scripts into localstorage as a seperate affair?\n\nCSS maybe, see https://github.com/addyosmani/basket.js/issues/60. Images, no, it would be slow and unnecessary and most likely slow don't page load since localStorage is loaded into the memory from hdd on pageload, would also exceed quota a lot. Images also doesn't block rendering, so I don't see the benefit.\n\n---\n\nThat said, appcache was created to make resources available offline, localStorage as key/value store, and basket.js exploits it for an attempt at improving script loading. One change in the manifest requires all files to be redownloaded. There are benefits and downsides to all of them. Depends on your usage and requirements. We should make an attempt to document these clearly and in what situations you would benefit from using basket.js\n"

It'll increase maintainability a lot and we can then decide which plugins we'd support and which ones we'll leave up to the community. My $0.02. \n\nNo offense to you, @amrnt.

If we make it easy to override the behaviour of that function then it is trivial for people to make their own plugins and I have no problem with not baking in behaviour in the distribution for different types.\n\nI imagine that you could add CSS support with something like:\n\n``` javascript\nbasket.addHandler( 'text/css', function( obj ) {\n    var el = document.createElement( 'style' );\n    el.setAttribute( 'type', 'text/css' );\n    if ( el.styleSheet ) { // >= IE6\n        el.styleSheet.cssText = obj.data;\n    } else { // Rest\n        el.appendChild( document.createTextNode( obj.data ) );\n    }\n});\n```\n\nwhich is simple enough that you can just write it into the documentation if people want it.\n"

        "body": "It's for use by web apps that _may_ be offline. In the example of a Twitter client, let's say that in the morning I go fetch your tweets while online. Later on I'm on the tube and go back to get your tweets. I can't get a live version, but I can get it from the cache and show a message letting the user know that the data is not fresh.\n\nThis requires that the data is cached, so it goes through basket and we want to cache for a longish time (a week maybe). But when we have connection we want to get the latest, and update the cache with that.\n\nDoes that make sense?\n\nThe logic should probably be:\n- `live` is false\n  - behave as now, returning from the cache if possible, over the network otherwise.\n- `live` is true and can't fetch (timeout or navigator.onLine === false, not just a 404)\n  - return from cache if available, perhaps flag that the result is not live even though it was requested\n- `live` is true and network is available\n  - fetch over the network and update the cache\n"

I personally wouldn't mind us exploring other storage formats if we can land them in a way that is modular or can be added in an optional way that wouldn't heavily increase the basic script size for all users.\n\nCould you talk us through how you've approached this? Does your core include larger storage support directly? Love to hear more!\n"

        "body": "### Feasibility review\n- Basket.js is currently 4.4KB and 1.1KB minified and gzipped. Switching to bag.js takes us up to 3.2KB gzipped + minified. Quite a large change. I would expect us to try offering a build of bag/basket something smaller than 3.2KB which just localStorage support for legacy users and offer up the complete build for developers interested in the whole thing. That said, 3.2KB is still relatively small considering the additions we get. How modular do you think we could get @puzrin? We could always land the changes then work towards modularity if we decide to move forward with the changes.\n- Changing over means that we would not be 100% backwards compatible. I would be interesting in nailing down exactly what breaking changes this brings (what in the bag.js API doesn't cover what is in basket?) over so that at least, we can document them if we go ahead. At present, basket.js does one thing and does it well. Some might argue that what basket.js offers at present is enough and that the newer additions may not be used as often. I'd love to hear more from users here.\n- We recently landed a bunch of changes around different types of [resource handling](https://github.com/addyosmani/basket.js/commit/dd93c360c80599bf413d8c39956eac93e764e7f1). Are you using the same codebase for that, does bag.js achieve the same thing or similar in terms of what is possible?\n- The changes to tests I'm interested in, but they won't be affecting a decision on my part. Your test coverage includes tests for most main use-cases so we should be solid on that front. Version bump is also okay :)\n\nOne idea is to label the current version of basket.js a final 1.0 and make the bag.js version our 2.0, which could indeed come with breaking changes.\n"

I had no reasons to do that for my projects.\n- there is one main reason for incompatibility. basket uses sync api for localstorage access (`basket.get()`). indexeddb & websql are async. You can do nothing with that without api change. Second reason is using node.js-like callbacks instead of promisses.\n- logic is very similar. i've tryed to implement all features of basket from master, because don't like to reinvent the wheel. Main differences are:\n  - `get` method is now for `kv` access (in pair with `set`). In basket it looks like dirty hack (can't imagine that someone need it in real life except testing).\n  - bag uses arrays of params for parallel loading instead of chaining. And execute scripts when then all loaded. Executing can be improved, but i had no practical reasons to spend time for that.\n  - expiration logic for localstore is simplified: when no space - everything is cleared. That can be improved, but in general, if you have big data - just use indexeddb/websql.\n  - coding style is from my progects, instead of your one.\n\nIMHO, someone should compare APIs & internals to understand all details. If you skip parts of indexeddb/websql implementations, the rest of code is quite small.\n"

        "body": "Thanks for getting back to the questions so quickly :)\n- I'll read up on the adapters, but anything that gives us pluggable options would be amazing. That would definitely make this work landable.\n- Re: incompatibility. We had once discussed using https://github.com/slightlyoff/async-local-storage to offer an async API that felt like localStorage on top of IndexedDB. If we're basically getting a basket-like API on top of the other storage forms, I would be okay with the break in API.\n- Re: callbacks vs promises. Is there a reason bag.js prefers callbacks to promises? With ES6 promises landing in browsers and a [shim](https://github.com/jakearchibald/ES6-Promises) being available on top of RSVP, it seems like a step backwards to not support them. Is this something we might be able to change? I'm just trying to understand the value of the callback approach.\n- Thanks for your explanation of the implementation and differences. I agree that we can improve the expiration logic to be a little closer to what the current basket offers. I also think that we could help adapt the coding style to adhere to what we've been using so far.\n\nI'm going to spend time reviewing the rest of the bag.js implementation today. Once again, I REALLY appreciate the effort you're taking to explain it to us and work to maybe contribute it back to the project. I'd love to see that happen.\n"

There's [some known issues](https://github.com/andrewwakeling/ie-css-bugs) with orphaned style elements in IE.\nThe CSS feature in bag.js (unlike the JS solution) has some caveats and in some cases, people may need to modify their CSS to get it working. I have discussed these issues in #60. Documenting those caveats would be preferable as reliably solving those issues would be difficult.\n\nI have limited experience with Promises, but I usually find that callbacks are sufficient for my needs. I am not a huge fan of shims as they tend to bloat libraries. Even though they are \"optional\", I find myself always loading them because I need to support older browsers. Having said that, I do not feel strongly about the RSVP dependency being in basket.js. The difference in size is still fairly negligible.\n\nCan we support callbacks if the RSVP dependency is absent?\n\nI am a big fan of modularity but I lack experience over both projects to say that it's needed right now.\n\nAlso, I really like the new pre-release changes to basket.js. Thanks!\n"

I'm not sure I see the original issue prompting this.\n\nSure. When we store everything except data itself in the key the difficult part would be fetching the item we need.\nUser write `basket.get('my-item');`. How do we find it in the localStorage?\nIt will be stored as:\n`basket-my-item\\t{url:'...'}`\nSo we have to iterate over localStore items, try to split based on basketKey, then split based by separator and then check what left between them. If it matches original request - all is good, else - continue iterating. And that part with splitting, splitting again and then matching strings would not be fast itself. So we want to limit it.\nWhat I am suggesting is to form map between user keys and full prefixed keys with props during remove command. During remove we either way iterate though all the collection and try to find all the basket items to check their expiration date. Just as well we can form following map:\n\n``` js\nvar map = {\n    'my-item': 'basket-my-item\\t{url: \"...\"}'\n};\n```\n"

Then iterate and check.\n\nIndeed, we can even make it `new RegExp('basket-' + key + propsSeparator)` so we would _not_ receive extra results (e.g. key was 'foo-bar', we might have got 'basket-foo-bar' and 'basket-foo-bar-baz').\n\nSounds like a plan.\n\nThis seems faster than my splitting option. \nStill we will have to check how fast/slow it is in real life. Imagine you have 5 items not related to basket and 5 basket scripts in localStorage.\nYou load your application and as usual require 5 scripts. For each of them we would iterate over localStorage, check regex. That would be 50 checks total. In case of map there might have been just 10 (though have to try first).\n"

The whole site obviously was messed up.\n\nA search on the Web drove me to this Stackoverflow answer: http://stackoverflow.com/a/20848924. This was exactly my case: after correcting the integrity level of the `%userprofile%\\Appdata\\LocalLow` the localstorage begun to works good.\n\nNow, before execute basketjs, I test localstorage[1]:\n\n``` javascript\nfunction lsTest(){\n    var test = 'test';\n    try {\n        localStorage.setItem(test, test);\n        localStorage.removeItem(test);\n        return true;\n    } catch(e) {\n        return false;\n    }\n}\n\nif(lsTest() === true){\n    console.log('presente');\n}else{\n    console.log('assente');\n}\n```\n\n[1] http://stackoverflow.com/a/16427747\n"

The only way we found, was to patch the library in two spots.\n- at the `isCacheValid` function made sure to check if `navigator.onLine`. If it is, then we claim that the cache **is** valid. _(but beware if you patch here: the line `shouldFetch = isCacheValid(source, obj);` is not easy to interpret. seems twisted to me)_\n- at the bottom, check if the `basket.clear(true)` works for you. We removed it, because we felt it removed the cache too early. even if there was no internet connection and the app had no chance to get a fresher version.\n\nNow it works fine for us. Even in offline situations. \n"

        "body": "I have been playing with `basket.js` lately, as I find the idea behind it fascinating... I do think it would be useful to have an array of the resources that failed to be retrieved.\n\nLooking at the code, I believe that the behavior described in this ticket is caused by the fact that internally `basket.js` uses `RSVP.all(promises)` which gets rejected immediately if any promise in the array is rejected. This doesn't allow us to keep track of the scripts that failed to load.\n\nA potential enhancement would be to modify the `require` method to accept an optional `trackFailures` argument, and if it's truthy then `basket` will use `RSVP.allSettled(promises)` (instead of `RSVP.all(promises)`) which fulfills (or rejects) with an array of the promises' result states, allowing us to keep track of the failures in a more elegant way.\n\nI wouldn't mind working on a PR that implements this solution If the project's core members believe that this would be useful.\n\nIn the meantime, you can have a workaround by doing something like this:\n\n``` javascript\n// define one valid URL and two invalid ones\nvar urls = [\n        'https://badurl1/x.js',\n        'https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/jquery/3.0.0-alpha1/jquery.min.js',\n        'https://badurl2/y.js'\n    ],\n    failedUrls = [],\n    i;\n\n// closure that lets us deal with each url individually\nvar getResource = function (url) {\n    basket.require({url: url}).then(function () {}, function (err) {\n        // deal with the failures here\n        // for this example we just push the failed url to an array to be checked later\n        failedUrls.push(url);\n    });  \n};\n\n// get the resources\nfor (i = 0; i < urls.length; i++) {\n    getResource(urls[i]);\n}\n\n// wait a little bit for all the 'requires' to be fullfilled or rejected\n// and check the 'failedUrls' array to see which ones failed\nsetTimeout(function () {\n    console.log(failedUrls) // expect: [\"https://badurl1/x.js\", \"https://badurl2/y.js\"]\n}, 500);\n```\n\nCheers!\n"

Instead of `trackFailures`, perhaps we could use a third argument as seen in other [thenables](http://howtonode.org/promises), which would be used to track progress, see [here](https://gist.github.com/domenic/3889970).\n\nFor example;\n\n``` js\nbasket.require(\n    { url: '//example.com', key: 'jquery' },\n    { url: '//example.com', key: 'other' })\n    .then(function(){\n        console.log(\"All loaded okay\");\n    }, function(err) {\n        console.log(\"Failed to load all scripts\");\n    }, function(event, args) {\n        // event=loaderror\n        // args={key:'jquery':, url: 'http://...', reason: ..., err: ...]\n     })\n```\n\nAnother option is introducing `on` and `fail`, like such;\n\n``` js\nbasket.require(\n    { url: '//example.com', key: 'jquery' },\n    { url: '//example.com', key: 'other' })\n    .then(function(){\n        console.log(\"All loaded okay\");\n    })\n    .fail(function(err) {\n        console.log(\"Failed to load all scripts\");\n    })\n    .on('loaderror', function(key, url, reason, err) {\n        // {key:'jquery':, url: 'http://...', reason: ..., err: ...]\n     })\n```\n\nThese all get the same job done, just exposed in different ways. @addyosmani do you have any preference?\n"

        "body": "I know I shouldn't bring back this issue from the dead, but I wanted to comment on my experience with this. I tried @andrewwakeling code and sort of works for simple requirejs projects. \n\nHowever, when we deal with several modules, each of them calling an anonymous `define` and meant to be optimized separately, it doesn't work. During the first load everything goes fine and every script is stored in localStorage. During the second load, everyone of these modules threw:\n\n``` js\n    mismatch Error: Mismatched anonymous define() module:\n```\n\nWhich makes sense because they have an anonymous define inside of them, mind you.\n\nSo I tried turning this to a plugin. \n\n``` js\ndefine(function () {\n    var frombasket = {\n        load: function (name, parentRequire, parentLoad, config) {\n            var fileUrl = parentRequire.toUrl(name + '.js');\n            if (config.isBuild) {\n                parentLoad();\n                return;\n            } else {\n                basket.require({\n                        url: fileUrl\n                    }).then(function () {\n                        parentRequire([name], function (value) {\n                            parentLoad(value);\n                            return;\n                        });\n                    }, function (error) {\n                        return parentLoad.error(error);\n                    });\n            }\n        }\n    };\n    return frombasket;\n});\n```\n\nWhich means that, instead of overriding `requirejs.load` method, I picked which modules to load with basketjs:\n\n``` js\ndefine([\n   'frombasket!vendor/jquery.min',\n   'frombasket!vendor/d3.min',\n   'frombasket!vendor/handlebars.amd.min',\n   'app/mymodule'\n],function(jQuery, d3, Handlebars, myModule) {\n   ...\n});\n```\n\nBut it was basically the same. Common libraries loaded ok, but unbuilt modules didn't. So I modified the plugin to have basketjs pass the raw code to requirejs:\n\n``` js\ndefine(function () {\n    var frombasket = {\n        load: function (name, parentRequire, parentLoad, config) {\n            var fileUrl = parentRequire.toUrl(name + '.js');\n            if (config.isBuild) {\n                parentLoad();\n                return;\n            } else {\n                basket.require({\n                        url: fileUrl,\n                        execute:false\n                    }).then(function (result) {\n                        parentLoad.fromText(result.data);\n\n                        parentRequire([name], function (value) {\n                            parentLoad(value);\n                            return;\n                        });\n                    }, function (error) {\n                        return onLoadNative.error(error);\n                    });\n            }\n        }\n    };\n    return frombasket;\n});\n```\n\nBut it's even worse, because any dependencies in the form of named modules can't be resolved when you load a module with `parentLoad.fromText`. The main requirejs config, which contains the paths, isn't properly injected to the loaded and eval'd code.\n\nSo, for the time being, the first plugin code, as well as @andrewwakeling code, are safe to use only to store and request scripts that either are wrapped as UMD, or at least define themselves with an explicit name.\n"

This appears to be 'against' the intent of bower but is clearly possible as RSVP have managed it\r\n\r\nI think that for 1 and 2 (and I might be massively wrong here) the map files don't offer much value without the minified JS so I think it would make sense to exclude them from the bower package"
