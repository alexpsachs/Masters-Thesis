        "body": "Javascript stores strings internally as UTF-16, i.e. 2 bytes per character. And it happens that latin1 encoding is exactly first 256 characters of Unicode, or first byte of javascript string characters, stripping the second one. It also happens that this is exactly what 'binary' encoding in Node.js does. So all encoding/decoding is done by Node.js itself using 'binary' encoding.\nHope this helps.\n\nAbout the deprecation and replacement - it would need some research on performance. Native solutions are usually much faster. I don't have spare time right now to do that, but I'll be happy if you are willing to participate on it.\n"

The best I could do is to work with Buffers as much as possible and convert to/from strings on the boundaries - this turned out to be much faster than working with strings/chars directly, giving the byte-by-byte nature of encoding conversion.\n\nKeeping that in mind, I don't think there will be significant gains of decoding straight from the strings, especially in the light of needing to keep 2 versions of all decoding routines. Creating a small buffer is cheap nowadays, it's allocated from pools (I'm sure you knew that), so the only thing that we skip is writing a binary-encoded string to a buffer, which is also pretty cheap AFAIK.\n\nAlso, I believe a better way to do it in your project might be to feed decoder directly with slices of original buffer. This will require stateful codec approach, which is planned for v0.3, together with streaming.\n\nSo, I propose using current approach for now and optimize when v0.3 will be out (though no timeline promises here).\nBTW, I published a v0.2.10 to accept binary-encoded strings directly in `decode` function.\n"

        "body": "Yes, I agree about the boundary. Short test has shown that with string len=10, js routine is 5x faster than Buffer.write() with 'utf8' encoding. But on 100 char strings they are already equal in time. On 1000 char - js is 7.5x slower. Maybe this optimization could take better place in the node.js core.\n\n``` javascript\n(function() {\n    var buf = new Buffer(1000);\n    var str = '';\n    for (var i = 0; i < 10; i++)\n        str = str + 'helloworld'; // sample 10 char string.\n\n    var start = Date.now();\n    for (var i = 0; i < 1000000; i++) {\n        for (var j = 0, k = 0; j < str.length; j++) {\n            var c = str.charCodeAt(j);\n            if (c < 0x80) {\n                buf[k++] = c;\n            } else {\n                // Here we'll implement utf8.\n            }\n        }\n    }\n    console.log(\"JS only: \", Date.now() - start);\n\n    start = Date.now();\n    for (var i = 0; i < 1000000; i++) {\n        buf.write(str);\n    }\n    console.log(\"Cross-boundary: \", Date.now() - start);\n\n})() // Wrapped in function to let V8 optimize it.\n```\n\nAnyway I'll close this issue if you don't mind, because of the double-codebase concern.

Currently, iconv-lite use \"gbkcode & 0x80\" to tell if it will use the encoding table, so these two special mapping won't work.\n"

        "body": "When you work with text data in javascript, you usually work in the following steps:\n1. Get some bytes with known encoding from external source (you get Buffer).\n2. Convert the source Buffer to a native js string (which is itself utf-16), using `iconv.decode` or `buf.toString('utf-8')`.\n3. Do something with native js strings. These are the only strings you can meaningfully work with. \n4. Convert output native js strings to an output Buffer encoded with destination encoding. (`iconv.encode` or `new Buffer(str, 'utf-8')`)\n5. Send output Buffer (bytes) to external party.\n\nSo, in your case I assume that the `str` is given to you as a native js string and so it's utf-16, not utf-8. If not, please ensure it's correctly decoded (just print it to console).\n\nSecond step, where you're converting it to an iso-8859-8 **Buffer**, is good.\n\nThe last line (`str = buf.toString()`) is meaningless because you're trying to read iso-8859-8 encoded buffer as a utf-8 encoded buffer -> you'll get garbage.\n\nAfter conversion to something other than native js strings, you should work with Buffers, not trying to convert it back. Usually you'll need some concatenation, use `Buffer.concat([buf1, buf2])`.\n"

        "body": "Hi~(_^__^_)\n\nI didn't know there is an Encoding Standard for web. I'm kind of believing in the Unicode religion, and think the Unicode is the encoding standard for web. End users should be forced to generate new information in Unicode form if they are willing to communicate these information globally. So for now I just can't see a point for a standard converting API built into browsers. I think the Unicode is the answer, not a new converting API in every browsers.\n\nBut we do need some kind of way to convert legacy information into the new Unicode representation form. By we, I mean information vendors who are hosting a server. There are information who have difficulties to rebuild from scratch in Unicode form. We should leave these information in their original form if possible. Modern browsers have capability to view these legacy forms. If there ever be a converting is needed, it should be done only once, so it's better for server to do this job. What we need is a code mapping way able to upgrade most legacy information into Unicode form.\n\nAbout the upgrade mapping way, I vote for the Windows CP932 as the source form (I didn't know CP932 is a super set of SHIFTJIS). I think Windows has the major end user usage share in Japan. Well, I didn't conduct a surgery. Maybe add the Mac encoding is fine either.\n\nThe mapping table in http://encoding.spec.whatwg.org/#indexes is said comes from formerly proprietary extensions from IBM and NEC. So even IBM and NEC have abandoned these mapping, I think there is no need to write new code for them, and it looks like CP932 is also built from IBM and NEC 's idea, maybe they just share many common parts. I think if it's really needed, maybe could merge those two, but it's easier to just follow CP932: ftp://ftp.unicode.org/Public/MAPPINGS/VENDORS/MICSFT/WINDOWS/CP932.TXT\n\nBut if CP932 has some copyright issues, then I guess we have to follow the Encoding Standard mapping.\n\n(excuse me for \u2460)\n"

I'm using iconv-lite to do streaming conversion on HTTP responses, but most sites don't actually return the \"real\" charset as part of the HTTP response, so I'm actually forced to get that string out of the <meta charset> HTML tag, after the stream is processed, which kinda defeats the purpose of using iconv-lite as part of the response pipeline. \n\nBasically what I need is to convert whatever stream of data I pass to iconv-lite, and make sure I get UTF-8. And the [tests that I'm doing](https://github.com/tomas/needle/blob/master/test/iconv_spec.js) are not working. With some websites I get 'windows-1252' as a result, with others I get 'ascii', and with others 'SHIFT_JIS'.\n\nMaybe the jschardet library is the actual culprit?\n"

IMHO its a rare case.\n\nAlso, please be aware that iconv-lite in streaming decoding mode produces a stream of **strings**, not buffers.\n"

        "body": "> Just out of curiosity, where do you need that?\n\nWe have a SOAP service (which is XML bodies being sent) that we want to move into our routing layer using Node.js and route based on the SOAP header within the XML, so we want to decode the POSTed payloads. Because of the age of that technology, a lot of the POSTs are `text/html; charset=utf-16` (which UTF-16 includes the BOM so it can be determined if it is LE or BE). And yes, all the UTF-16 we are getting is BE, since that is what the Microsoft WCF accepts and it is network order.\n\nThere is already a UTF-16LE codec (same as in Node.js core). What would be nice would be a UTF-16BE codec, but what I think would be awesome if if there could also be a UTF-16 codec, which would wait for the first 2 bytes to be written to the decoder and then switch to LE or BE based on that or error is it's not a BOM (and perhaps the codec has an option to strip the BOM for the output?). The main problem is how such a \"UTF-16\" codec would work in encoding mode, since the name doesn't say the serialization order. Perhaps it can just be set to not allow serialization, or it takes an option to which order and if to automatically insert the appropriate BOM.\n\nAll of the BOM stuff can be solved without this library helping, but manually reading off the first 4 bytes and creating the appropriate codec here, so it's definitely not a must-have, but if there was a UTF-16 codec with BOM reading, it would mean we could directly pass in the stream and ask for the codec with the name of the `charset` in the `content-type`.\n"

        "body": "Hi! \n\nI haven't checked it manually, but I think most names that are used in the real world will be interpreted correctly. First, names are not case sensitive in iconv-lite and all non-alphanumeric characters are stripped, as well as what seems like a year suffix (i.e. `ISO_8859-1:1987` = `ISO8859-1` = `iso88591`). Then, there are lots of aliases, for example `win1251` = `windows1251` = `1251` = `Windows-1251`.\n\nIf you have a limited set of encodings that you support, you can check them all with `iconv.encodingExists(name)` function. Then, you can either tell me to add an alias, or do it in your project with the following code:\n\n```\nvar iconv = require('iconv-lite');\niconv.encode('utf8', ''); // load encoding definitions\niconv.encodings['<new alias name>'] = '<alias to what>'; // both lowercase, alphanumeric.\n```\n\nIf, on the other hand, you want to support all IANA names and aliases, then, probably, iconv-lite is not an option because it doesn't support all the older encodings (neither do node-iconv AFAIK).\n"

Moreover, invalid portions will need to be in Buffer-s, as we couldn't convert them to js string.\n\nIf there is really a smarter way to handle multiple invalid chars as opposed to single, then I'd suggest using the same callback, but passing multiple invalid bytes to it as a Buffer.

That's what they\u00a0say:\n\n> A simple encoder may encode all\u00a0characters it\u00a0considers safe for\u00a0direct encoding directly. However, the\u00a0cost of ending a\u00a0Unicode sequence, outputing a\u00a0single character directly in\u00a0ASCII and\u00a0then starting another Unicode sequence is 3 to 3\u2154 bytes. This\u00a0is more than the 2\u2154 bytes needed to\u00a0represent the\u00a0character as a\u00a0part of a\u00a0Unicode sequence.\n\nImagine a\u00a0medium where most characters are encoded with some default encoding (probably one\u00a0byte per\u00a0character, such\u00a0as CP866 or\u00a0\u041aOI-8R), but the\u00a0rest are converted to\u00a0UTF-7. Such a\u00a0method (`.split`) would facilitate a\u00a0smarter handling of \u201cinvalid\u201d characters and\u00a0even a\u00a0smarter way of dealing with single \u201cvalid\u201d characters that\u00a0appear surrounded by the\u00a0\u201cinvalid\u201d.\n"

Five of\u00a0them (`'utf8'`, `'cesu8'`, `'unicode11utf8'`, `'ucs2'`, `'utf16le'`) are Unicode encodings and\u00a0thus `.split(inputString, encodingUnicode)` would also simply return `[inputString]` for\u00a0them. The\u00a0remaining three encodings (`'binary'`, `'base64'`, `'hex'`) have simple regexp character classes that define the\u00a0supported characters (`/[\\x00-\\xFF]/`, `/[A-Za-z0-9+\\/]/`, `/[0-9A-Fa-f]/`) and\u00a0thus `String#split` could be used as `iconvLite#split` for\u00a0them (after these\u00a0classes are\u00a0negated to\u00a0produce encodable substrings in\u00a0even positions instead\u00a0of odd).\n"

        "body": "Well, I\u00a0hope I\u00a0have some (more or\u00a0less compelling) use\u00a0case.\n\nYou\u00a0know how the\u00a0UTF-7 was first invented, right? There\u00a0was (and\u00a0still somewhere is) a\u00a0medium (MIME\u00a0headers) where Unicode was\u00a0not permitted and\u00a0thus any characters of\u00a0a Unicode string either would fit\u00a0in the\u00a0other (ASCII) encoding or would have to\u00a0be encoded (using ASCII characters) and\u00a0escaped (not\u00a0to\u00a0be confused with\u00a0real ASCII characters).\n\nI have to\u00a0face another similar medium now. That\u00a0medium is [Fidonet](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fidonet) where the\u00a0design of the\u00a0most popular message\u00a0editor ([GoldED+](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GoldED#GoldED.2B)) makes any\u00a0support of the multibyte encodings in\u00a0GoldED+ impossible. Therefore it\u00a0is also not possible to\u00a0simply write Unicode messages to\u00a0Fidonet and expect\u00a0them to\u00a0be ever read\u00a0by\u00a0the\u00a0users of GoldED+; however, if the\u00a0text is mostly in\u00a0Russian, it\u00a0becomes possible to\u00a0write most of\u00a0the\u00a0message in\u00a0a\u00a0single-byte encoding (such\u00a0as [CP866](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Code_page_866)), split\u00a0out the\u00a0substrings that won't fit, encode\u00a0them differently and\u00a0escape\u00a0them (not to\u00a0be confused with the\u00a0rest of message).\n\nIf a\u00a0standard arises for\u00a0such encoding and\u00a0escaping, then the\u00a0other message\u00a0editors (and mere Fidonet browsers and\u00a0WebBBS) could collectively embrace and\u00a0extend GoldED+.\n\nSpeaking of the different encoding of\u00a0such substrings, at\u00a0first I\u00a0suggested ([there](http://ftn.su/m/RU.FTN.DEVELOP/2:50/88+53c38653), last paragraph) that it\u00a0could\u00a0be [Punycode](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Punycode); then Serguei\u00a0E.\u00a0Leontiev [pointed\u00a0out](http://ftn.su/m/RU.FTN.DEVELOP/%3C1187490639@ddt.demos.su%3E+555d042e) that UTF-7 is more\u00a0compact.\n\nHowever, before they\u00a0are differently encoded, these\u00a0substrings (outside\u00a0of CP866\u00a0range) have\u00a0to\u00a0be isolated, split\u00a0out\u00a0of the\u00a0string containing the\u00a0original (Unicode) text of the\u00a0message. That's my use\u00a0case for the `.split` method suggested\u00a0above.\n"

        "body": "I'm thinking about the latter case, that would be more convenient and probably faster too. There is one issue though - as iconv-lite is stream-oriented and working chunk-by-chunk, I would not want to accumulate ranges of invalid characters, because we can run out of memory on very long invalid streams.\n\nSo I'm thinking about the following interface:\n\n``` javascript\nfunction unencodableHandler(str, offset, context, rangeStarted, rangeFinished) {\n  // str is a string of unencodable characters.\n  // offset - index of str in context.\n  // context is the whole string (chunk) currently encoded.\n  // rangeStarted flag is true when str starts a range of contiguous invalid characters.\n  // rangeFinished flag is true when str completes the range.\n  // Flags are always true in non-streaming usage.\n\n  // Return characters that can be translated thus far.\n  return (rangeStarted ? start_escape : \"\") + escape(str) + (rangeFinished ? end_escape : \"\");\n}\n\n// Convert a string - all unencodable strings will be complete.\nbuf = iconv.encode(str, \"cp866\", {unencodableHandler: unencodableHandler});\n\n// Or a stream\ninputStream.pipe(iconv.encodeStream(\"cp866\", {unencodableHandler: unencodableHandler})).pipe(outStream);\n```\n"

        "body": "LGTM.\n\nThat `context` thing would seem more helpful if\u00a0it\u00a0was guaranteed to\u00a0contain some\u00a0context both\u00a0before and\u00a0after the `srt` (e.g. to\u00a0decide whether the\u00a0default `start_escape` / `end_escape` values are appropriate and\u00a0efficient for\u00a0that\u00a0context).\n\nFor\u00a0example, as [Wikipedia\u00a0says](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UTF-7#Description) about UTF-7,\n\n> The end is indicated by\u00a0any character not\u00a0in the\u00a0modified Base64\u00a0set. If\u00a0the\u00a0character after the\u00a0modified Base64 is a `-` (ASCII hyphen-minus) then it\u00a0is consumed by the\u00a0decoder and\u00a0decoding resumes with the\u00a0next character. Otherwise decoding resumes with the\u00a0character after the\u00a0base64.\n\nThus `end_escape` could be `''` by\u00a0default and `'-'` if `context` contains its\u00a0own `'-'` after the `str`.\n\nHowever, in\u00a0practice `end_escape` is\u00a0going to\u00a0be `'-'` by\u00a0default and\u00a0become `''` only\u00a0if `context` does\u00a0contain some\u00a0other character (not\u00a0a\u00a0minus) after the `str`. (If `context` just\u00a0ends there, it\u00a0might\u00a0mean a\u00a0mere\u00a0end of the\u00a0current chunk and\u00a0there's no\u00a0guarantees that the\u00a0next\u00a0chunk won't start with its own `'-'`.)\n\nHowever, that's still better than not having `context` at\u00a0all. Good\u00a0enough.\n"

Unfortunately, Node.js keeps it by default  (see joyent/node#1918). Then, GBK encoding has no code for the BOM character, so iconv-lite replaces it by '?'.\n\nSolutions:\n1. Add `data = data.replace(/^\\uFEFF/, '');` before encoding.\n2. Use ['strip-bom' module](https://github.com/sindresorhus/strip-bom) for more readability.\n\nLet me know if it helps.\n"

The solution is simple: add `<meta charset=\"UTF-8\">` to header to avoid those encoding tables to be screwed.\n\nBefore setting charset explicitly, the `mappingTable` inside `DBCSCodec` constructor looks like: \n\n![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/5248918/7214886/199bb64e-e5f2-11e4-8c20-5544d6e8275d.png)\n\nAfter:\n\n![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/5248918/7214896/5c9594a6-e5f2-11e4-9389-0c5c4e6610d0.png)\n\nOne thing I've no idea why is, the chars in those json tables will only be broken in some strange condition, in order to reproduce the problem, I have to be:\n- inside a Chrome App\n- use AngularJS and enable [ng-csp](https://docs.angularjs.org/api/ng/directive/ngCsp) mode\n- inside html, use mustache expression to render some variable `MyValue = {{ myvalue }}` (this step is neccessary, the variable can be anything inside the scope)\n\n**Thank you for creating this awesome module BTW!**\n"

How do you see it in code (from your side, not internally)?\n\nAt the moment we have completely separate operations of decode vs encode, with only strings between them, so I don't really know how to pass this \"if file had a BOM\" information. We shouldn't keep the BOM in decoded strings, right?\n\nMoreover, right now for UTF8 and UTF16 we pass the data straight to native Node.js implementation, so it might be a bit tricky to handle, although probably possible.\n"

        "body": "Hi Alexander, thanks for the prompt reply. I was thinking a little bit about what API could work and came to the conclusion that ideally this would all be handled from the encoding name itself. Imagine alongside utf8, utf16le and utf16be we would have utf8_bom, utf16le_bom and utf16be_bom. This would make the choice of BOM very explicit and would also bind it to the actual encoding. In other words, it would not make sense to have an option to set the bom for an encoding that does not know any BOM (e.g. cp1252).\n\nI am currently only using the encode/decode API where imho for encode() this would work nicely:\n- encode() would add the BOM if the encoding indicates so\n- encode() would remove any BOM if the encoding does not indicate to add a BOM\n- encode() would remove any wrong BOMs if a node buffer is passed in in both cases\n\nFor decode() its a bit weird though, I have to say. I think decode() should _always_ remove the BOM from the string returned. It could still treat utf8_bom, utf16be_bom and utf16le_bom as utf8, utf16be and utf16le.\n"

On my Windows machine with option `autocrlf true`, _Git for Windows_ checks out Windows-style `CRLF` and commits Unix-style `LF` line-endings.\n\nWith an increased file-size [the issue is reproducible on machines treating line-endings Unix-style](/bit-seq/iconv-lite-mcve/tree/ac04865b8b787954a8dd660d4d435c3d32ba99e7).\nI added lines to the example files to again have [`too-large.html`](/bit-seq/iconv-lite-mcve/blob/ac04865b8b787954a8dd660d4d435c3d32ba99e7/too-large/too-large.html) (508kb) causing problems, whereby file [`large.html`](/bit-seq/iconv-lite-mcve/blob/ac04865b8b787954a8dd660d4d435c3d32ba99e7/large/large.html) (504kb) decodes and encodes correctly. There's some debug output to generate files highlighting the content of every step and the according line-endings. On a unix or ios system there won't be any `CRLF`s on a checkout, however, by unzipping the [archive](/bit-seq/iconv-lite-mcve/blob/ac04865b8b787954a8dd660d4d435c3d32ba99e7/iconv-lite-mcve.zip) the first files of the chain should contain `CRLF`s. Calling the function `eolUnix` forces `LF` line-endings even for `CRLF` files.\n\nNode v0.12.7 still shows the affected behaviour. The result is correct using io.js v3.0.0 and node v4.0.0.\n"

This is because the `pipe()` method returns it's argument and not `this`. To make it work, you need to get the correct writeStream:\r\n```\r\nconst writeStream = iconv.encodeStream('win1250');\r\nwriteStream.pipe(fs.createWriteStream('out-win1250.txt'));\r\n```\r\n\r\nAlso, it's not recommended to use `.collect()` method together with piping data to another stream - the backpressure mechanisms will probably screw up. Only use `.collect()` at the end of the pipe."

Having a blacklist of files that don't need to be packaged (like in .npmignore) is safer than having a whitelist (like the \"files\" prop) because I won't need to remember to add new files there. This is easy to forget.\r\n\r\nI'm open to suggestions, but in general I think it makes a lot more sense to adjust npm2deb to use the npm's rules of inclusion and support all modules without changes. Otherwise you'll need to ask a lot of projects to adjust stuff."

I just checked it out and it maps symbol 1-33 to U+FF5E, see [this](https://encoding.spec.whatwg.org/index-jis0208.txt) and [this](https://encoding.spec.whatwg.org/jis0208.html). \r\n\r\nDo you have other sources except libiconv that map 1-33 to U+301C? You might want to file an issue to [encoding standard issue tracker](https://github.com/whatwg/encoding/issues). I see there's some [minor discussion](https://github.com/whatwg/encoding/issues/47#issuecomment-251083712) there about it.\r\n\r\nI can probably add the encoding pair U+301C -> 81 60 for Shift_JIS and CP932 to be more flexible, but for the decoding part I currently aim to follow encoding standard.\r\n\r\nWhat do you think?"

U+301C is the mapping according to Japan Industrial Standard (JIS X 0208).\r\n\r\n- Shift_JIS would be better to conform to JIS X 0208: Detailed encoding scheme is defined in Annex 1 of this standard.\r\n- EUC-JP would be better to conform to [eucjp-ascii](http://web.archive.org/web/19990203115405/http://www.opengroup.or.jp/jvc/cde/ucs-conv-e.html) defined by OSF/JVC.  Though it is not a national standard, it is identical to x-eucjp-open-19970715-ascii listed in [XML Japanese Profile](https://www.w3.org/TR/2000/NOTE-japanese-xml-20000414/).\r\n\r\nEven more characters are also given imcompatible mappings over two mappings above.  It is quite a mess for japanese users.  If you prefer, I'd like to provide changes.\r\n"

Appropriate names would be assigned to appropriate mappings.\r\n\r\n(Problem on indices beyond 8836 (94 \u00d7 94) would be separate matter.  They are simply beyond the domain of definition for CCS by ISO/IEC, i.e. domain of extension by vendors.)\r\n\r\nOn ambiguity, several implimentations adds one-way (Unicode to legacy) mappings for non-standard encoding, e.g. U+2015 HORIZONTAL BAR to \\xA1\\xBD EM DASH, therefore roundtrip conversion between cp932-based and JIS-based mappings is more or less satisfied.\r\n\r\n---\r\n(Addition) As takahashim pointed out, mapping defined by JIS X 0213 is rarely used in practice.  It's an extension to JIS X 0208 but not compatible.\r\n"

Looking at https://github.com/ashtuchkin/iconv-lite/blob/master/lib/index.js#L61 , we can see that we have a \"lazy require\" statement.\r\n\r\nIn other words, we have a require statement which isn't being executed until `getCodec` function is executed. This is not a bug in `require()`. There are many reasons and conditions which could cause a lazy require statement to fail.\r\n\r\nIn the case I hit ( a production service serving millions of requests ), the Node.js process was being `chroot` to a new directory after the process started. This means that the relative path of `../encodings` is no longer valid, hence the errors. Generally, it's not safe to do a lazy require of modules.\r\n\r\nIs there a reason that `../encodings.js` file is being loaded lazily in `getCodec`? Could it be required outside the function scope?\r\n\r\nAlso, you could probably replicate the bug using https://www.npmjs.com/package/chroot library.\r\n"

Are you sure other libraries/modules don't use it? It's a perfectly valid mode of loading modules in node.js, as far as I know.\r\n\r\n> Is there a reason that ../encodings.js file is being loaded lazily in getCodec?\r\n\r\nYes, it's an explicit optimization of startup time. Encodings tree is large and can take several hundred ms to load. I don't want to impose this tax on all projects indirectly requiring iconv-lite because they might not use (or even know about) it at all.\r\n\r\nI still don't know why it works the second time for @dbussert - module caching should not depend on that."

You should understand that `require` is a synchronous and blocking statement. The same 100ms you are saving on initial load time will now be 100ms of blocked process time when `getCodec` is first called. I could go on and on. I won't. You are wrong, sorry.\r\n\r\nRegardless, I understand the need for optimization on start time. It's a trade-off you have to make. Based on what I see here, the majority of users will never experience this require failing issue and will benefit from the optimized start time. HOWEVER, some users are experiencing this issue and I'm telling you exactly why it's happening.\r\n\r\nYou should either figure out a fix, or tell us you will not fix it. I already proposed the solution we used in production. What none of us need here is reasons why you don't think this is broken.\r\n\r\nCheers."

        "body": "Dear @Marak,\r\n\r\nI'm yet to find evidence that others are experiencing the same issue as you are. All the other people in this thread have a situation where a restart \"fixes\" the problem, which should not happen with a chroot. Also I haven't seen any mention of chroot other than from you. So, I'm still gathering information about that case and would prefer you stop interfering and going personal about it. There's no need to preach about best practices, tell me what I should do, or talk like you represent all the other people in this thread.\r\n\r\nAs for your particular problem - no, I won't fix it for you. The core reason you have this problem is you built a system based on a subtly incorrect assumption that the node module system works correctly after a chroot. This subtle incorrectness showed itself when you started using iconv-lite, but it has potential to show for other modules as well. You cannot assume that other modules won't use a valid system interface because you think it's \"not a best practice\". I'm glad you found a workaround for your particular system, but 1) it's not guaranteed to work for other people, and 2) you'll need to find similar workarounds for other libraries/modules. I would've recommended to stop relying on the assumption above and try to fix your system in a more general way, like using a separate process to do the chroot and only start your original node process after that, but I don't have enough context about your system.\r\n\r\nTo be clear, I'm not being stubborn about making the change you suggested. I'm not doing that because:\r\n 1. As I said earlier, I don't have evidence that this what's actually happening for the OP and other people in this thread.\r\n 2. Each part of the current solution is there for a good reason:\r\n    1. Dynamic require provides the dont-pay-if-you-dont-use guarantee for users with regards to startup time, as we discussed previously.\r\n    2. Relative require path guarantees that I'm requiring file from the same exact module. As you might already know, there can be several versions of a module installed in a node_modules folder and I have no idea which one of them will be resolved to a top-level 'iconv-lite'. I hope I don't have to explain why this requirement is important."

The problem with these mappings  is that control characters in EBCDIC which do not translate have been given arbitrary unicode values starting at 0x80. This includes the NL character (0x20 in EBCDIC), which is assigned U+0080. On the systems I've touched the EBCDIC NL character is used in place of the LF character for marking EOL"

Remove the folder: node_modules\r\n```\r\nrm -fr node_modules\r\n```\r\n3. Install again\r\n```\r\nnpm install\r\n```\r\n\r\n4. And then run my JS code in React Native project. The code listed below:\r\n```javascript\r\n    let buf =  iconv.encode('\u5b89\u5b89\u8981\u4e56\u4e56\\n', 'GBK' );\r\n    let str=iconv.decode(buf,'GBK');\r\n    console.log(str);\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe code works as expected, and no error found.\r\n\r\nSo I think the problem has been solved. Thank you very much!\r\n\r\n"

I.e. at the last discussion of this in March, the CTC decided to not set a timeframe for runtime deprecation yet.\r\n\r\nThat doesn't mean that it can't happen , though. It definitely won't happen before 9.0 (October 2017) and I find it unlikely that it will happen in 9.0 (though personally I would prefer to see that in).\r\n\r\nThere are other resons why you shouldn't be using the old API, though.\r\n\r\nAlso note that the `safe-buffer` polyfill is only needed for Node.js versions 4.4.x and lower, 5.x branch, 0.10 branch and 0.12 branch. I don't think that's really needed nowdays."

        "body": "Hey, there's several things going on here:\r\n 1. Using `str = iconvlite.decode(buffer3, \"1255\");`, you're converting from a win1255-encoded buffer to a JS string. JS string doesn't have encoding, it's just a list of characters.\r\n 2. When you do `console.log(str)`, the string is converted to whatever encoding your terminal has and shows you the characters.\r\n 3. When you do `fs.writeFile(\"...\", str, ..)`, Node writes your JS string `str` to file using default encoding, which is utf-8. That's why you have utf-8 characters in that file.\r\n\r\nIf you want to save that string in win1255 encoding, just write the `buffer3` directly:\r\n`fs.writeFile(\"/home/USER/git/npm-test-1/windows-1255.txt\", buffer3, ..`\r\n\r\nSee more info in my wiki: https://github.com/ashtuchkin/iconv-lite/wiki and https://github.com/ashtuchkin/iconv-lite/wiki/Use-Buffers-when-decoding"

        "body": "Hey Eric, it looks like you're doing 4 conversions in your iconv function instead of one:\r\n```\r\nexport function iconv(inCharset: string, outCharset: string, str: string): string {\r\n    let buffer: Buffer = new Buffer(str);  // <-- this is the first one. It converts str to buffer using utf8 encoding.\r\n\r\n    str = iconvLite.decode(buffer, inCharset);  // <-- this is the second \r\n    buffer = iconvLite.encode(str, outCharset) as Buffer;  // <-- this is the third\r\n\r\n    return buffer.toString();  // <-- this is the fourth, converting buffer to string, using utf8 encoding.\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhen you're working with encoded strings, I really recommend using buffers for encoded data and convert them to strings when you need to display them or do some other work. Otherwise, it's easy to be confused with all the implicit conversions Node.js does for you. See also https://github.com/ashtuchkin/iconv-lite/wiki.\r\n\r\nIf you can't work with buffers directly, you can treat strings as binary-encoded buffers. In that case, when you convert to/from real buffers, use \"binary\" as the encoding (see https://nodejs.org/api/buffer.html#buffer_buffers_and_character_encodings):\r\n```\r\nlet buffer: Buffer = new Buffer(str, \"binary\");\r\nlet str = buffer.toString(\"binary\");\r\n```\r\n\r\nOne problem with that approach is, given you example, `'\u00c4\u00e9'` is not a valid utf-8 encoded string. To get a utf-8 encoded string, you should - you guessed it correctly - encode it first, *before* passing to your `iconv` function. Two options are `new Buffer(str).toString(\"binary\")`, or `iconvLite.decode(iconvLite.encode(str, \"utf8\"), \"binary\")`.\r\n\r\nLastly, '\ufffd' character means that bytes or characters are not representable in the encoding you want. Almost all encodings are destructive by their nature (utf8, utf16 etc being the exception), so you'll need to handle this in your code.\r\n\r\nLet me know if you need more info."

I would expect it to be present inside a test matrix if package.json states `\"node\": \">=0.10.0\"` in engines. Doing that would be a bit tricker though, as it would require also changing `devDependencies`, so it's probably outside of the scope for this PR."

But requiring your existing setup to be changed in order to use a version to me is semver major. Express 4 never required support for npm that understands `^` and so I'm not just going to suddenly introduce that in the 4.x line. The usage of a polyfill like `safer-buffer` is only necessary for these old versions, so I'm not sure why there was even a bother to add it in as a `dependency` (this module used to have zero dependencies prior) to add support for old versions if it's not going to support old versions here.\r\n\r\n > There's certainly no harm in switching this module to ~ - the typical danger is that you'll miss patches that aren't backported to every minor line, but i think that's probably fine here\r\n\r\nYea, so I was requested to change the range to `>= 2.1.2 < 3` and so the PR does use the wider range, which wouldn't end up missing those patches."

For example Node.js 4.0.0 doesn't work, but `Buffer.from` also doesn't exist in 4.0.0, which would change the detection mechanism here. I wonder if there is a different way to detect that commit without `Buffer.from` to prevent the false positives on the versions of Node.js between when it became Uint8Array-based and when Buffer.from was first added?"

        "body": "Hey Alex, \r\n\r\nFirst of all, thanks for the quick response and all your hard work on this library! It's really awesome that so many folks are finding it useful.\r\n\r\nI had an interesting Slack conversation today within my organization about semver and dependency management with Node in general. \r\n\r\nNewer npm tooling like package-lock.json and yarn.lock makes things \"better\" in that we can (and should!) pretty easily lock the entire depedency tree down, so that semver becomes less of an issue (arguably irrelevant). \r\n\r\nMost of the folks here are seem to agree that as a developer you are responsible for making sure breaking changes don't find their way into your code via these new tools, unfortunately, the npm defaults are still subseptible to breaking changes. \r\n\r\nRegarding the specific changes to your code, Changes to the buffer contructors here: \r\nhttps://github.com/ashtuchkin/iconv-lite/commit/59314034f2bb1a1d622023d8acfec64961629364 e.g `new Buffer` vs `Buffer.from` and `Buffer.alloc` are ultimately what caused an issue with our depenent module.  \r\n\r\nHere's the stack trace for reference:\r\n```\r\nUnable to import module 'functions/updateTranslations/handler': Error\r\nat Function.Module._resolveFilename (module.js:547:15)\r\nat Function.Module._load (module.js:474:25)\r\nat Module.require (module.js:596:17)\r\nat require (internal/module.js:11:18)\r\nat Object.<anonymous> (/var/task/node_modules/iconv-lite/lib/index.js:5:14)\r\nat Module._compile (module.js:652:30)\r\nat Object.Module._extensions..js (module.js:663:10)\r\nat Module.load (module.js:565:32)\r\nat tryModuleLoad (module.js:505:12)\r\nat Function.Module._load (module.js:497:3)\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe npm repo was older and not using the \"saftey net\" tooling mentioned above. \r\n\r\nUltimately it is up to you to adopt what approach you like, though the fact remains that a major change e.g. 1.0.0, prior to publishing the buffers would have prevented a break in our case.\r\n\r\nFeel free to close this issue, it was strictly for your visibility. \r\nThanks again!\r\n\ud83c\udf7b \r\nBen\r\n\r\n "

When building electron app, webpack is configured to use [target](https://webpack.js.org/configuration/target/) 'web' or 'electron-renderer'.\r\n2. This webpack target in turn takes [browser property](https://github.com/defunctzombie/package-browser-field-spec#ignore-a-module) into account. In this case, webpack ignores streams.js and extend-node.js from bundling because they are [set to false in the browser property in the package.json](https://github.com/ashtuchkin/iconv-lite/blob/master/package.json#L29).\r\n3. [index.js checks for node process and environment](https://github.com/ashtuchkin/iconv-lite/blob/master/lib/index.js#L138) to determine if it is in a node environment. But in the case of electron, it is both a browser environment and a node environment. So iconv thinks it is in a node environment when the bundler thinks it is bundling for a web environment. This leads to `__webpack_require__(...) is not a function` error because streams.js is never bundled."

Webpack correctly polyfills `require('stream')` for browsers that don't yet support streams nativly, so I made a quick and dirty monkeypatch to define those functions:\r\n\r\nhttps://gist.github.com/whitehat101/cb5696d669a94b11ab156b81b6392ead\r\n\r\nI just commented out the `module.exports` function braces and added `iconv = require('iconv-lite')`.

Normally overwhelmed by the bright solar disk, the expansive corona, the sun's outer atmosphere, is an alluring sight. But the subtle details and extreme ranges in the corona's brightness, although discernible to the eye, are notoriously difficult to photograph. Pictured here, however, using multiple images and digital processing, is a detailed image of the Sun's corona taken during the 2008 August total solar eclipse from Mongolia. Clearly visible are intricate layers and glowing caustics of an ever changing mixture of hot gas and magnetic fields. Bright looping prominences appear pink just above the Sun's limb. A similar solar corona might be visible through clear skies in a thin swath across the USA during a total solar eclipse that occurs just one week from tomorrow.\",\n   \"hdurl\":\"https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/1708/corona_druckmuller_1600.jpg\",\n   \"media_type\":\"image\",\n   \"title\":\"Detailed View of a Solar Eclipse Corona\",\n   \"url\":\"https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/1708/corona_druckmuller_960.jpg\"\n}\n```\nNotice the empty character or a box character instead of the \u0161.

        "body": "Hey Kiko, glad you like the library. I'm actually not really sure what \"base64 html entities\" you're talking about. There's regular [HTML entities](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Entity), but they are not base64 encoded - they use either a string or a number between \"&\" and \";\", e.g:\r\n\r\n|  HTML Entity  |  What it means  |  Decoded value  |\r\n| ------------- | ---------------- | ---------------- |\r\n| `&lt;` | \"less than\" character |  `<`  |\r\n| `&gt;` | \"greater than\" character | `>`  |\r\n| `&copy;` | \"copy\" character | `\u00a9`  |\r\n| `&#8224;` | unicode character number 8212 | `\u2020`  |\r\n\r\nAll HTML entities are ASCII, which is a proper subset of UTF-8, so there shouldn't be a problem decoding in either order. I'd still recommend decoding UTF-8 first to keep a clear process and mental model:\r\n 1. You usually start with bytes that you download from the website, plus encoding. Bytes in JS are represented by Buffer or Uint8Array. If you're getting a string from the download process - it has already been decoded and you need to fix that (likely by providing \"encoding: null\" or something).\r\n 2. Then, you decode these bytes using `iconv.decode` and get a JS string. JS string contains unicode characters and you can work with it using all JS operations like search/replace, regex, etc. \r\n 3. HTML Entities are a higher-level concept, so if you want to \"decode\" them, you'll have to use a different library or regexps on the JS string you got in the previous step. Note, decoding them would likely mess up the HTML structure, so I'd recommend doing this after fully parsing HTML and creating a DOM tree."
