As you said, creating a new kind of Signal would probably be a better solution or just change the application structure to circumvent this. I probably won't add this feature unless I need it or someone asks for it. I was keeping it as open because I was waiting for feedback...\n"

        "body": "I thought a lot about it and I think the best way to implement it is by creating a new kind of Signal, that way we avoid storing references to unneeded values and also make it harder to mess with the default behavior of third-party code (since it may break things badly). I also think that creating a new Signal type will make it clearer that it works differently.\n\nproposal:\n\n``` js\n//AsyncSignal keeps previous dispatch \"in memory\"\nvar intialized = new signals.AsyncSignal();\n\n//won't log anything for now since signal wasn't dispatched yet\ninitialized.add(function(t){\n  console.log('1: '+ t);\n});\n\n//log \"1: lorem-ipsum\"\ninitialized.dispatch('lorem-ipsum');\n\n//will log \"2: lorem-ipsum\" even tho the signal was dispatched before adding the listener\ninitialized.add(function(t){\n  console.log('2: '+ t);\n});\n\n//log \"1: foo\"\n//log \"2: foo\"\ninitialized.dispatch('foo');\n\n//will log \"3: foo\" (it uses previous dispatched value if it does exist)\ninitialized.add(function(t){\n  console.log('3: '+ t);\n});\n```\n\ncan probably re-use most of the regular `Signal` logic and just augment `add`, `addOnce` and `dispatch` logic.\n"

For now you can do like this:\n\n``` js\nvar Signal = require('vendor/signals').Signal;\nvar mySignal = new Signal();\n```\n\nThe namespace is more _future-proof_ since we can add new properties to the object at will, but I will keep this issue open to see if more people agree with the change and maybe that's the change that will motivate a `v1.0.0` release (since it's a breaking change).\n"

        "body": "ahhh I just found a non-breaking solution after hitting the send button! hehe\n\nIn JavaScript Functions are first-class objects, which means we can add properties to the function, so we could change the code to be:\n\n``` js\nfunction Signal(){\n  // ... regular code here\n}\n\n// expose constructor as a property as well\nSignal.Signal = Signal;\n```\n\nAnd just expose the `Signal` constructor for AMD and node.js without breaking legacy code! #winning\n\n``` js\nvar Signal = require('signals');\nvar mySignal = new Signal(); // works!\n// legacy support\nvar signals = require('signals');\nvar mySignal = new signals.Signal(); // still works\n```\n\nThis should definitely ship in the next version since it's non-breaking and will be less verbose... For the browser I think we should keep the current name `signals` for the namespace since it's weird to have lowercase constructors and user can just create an alias like [showed in the examples](https://github.com/millermedeiros/js-signals/wiki/Examples). The namespace is important for the browser since user might be using the `CompoundSignal` as well (which requires the global `signals` object)\n"

There would need to be some logic to protect against bouncing, as I presume switching from one storage format to the other would have a cost, and if the threshold was say 1,000 and you were at 999 and quickly added and removed a couple of handlers, you wouldn't want it converting back and forth automatically. Perhaps a large sigma type check, like that used in comparing floating point numbers could be of use, so they'd have to go down to like 980 after hitting the 1,000 mark to convert back? May be best to just leave it up to user to decide though.\n"

Nice work.\nI'm not sure if you're still considering this topic, but some feedback on the API change ideas. _Listen_ doesn't make as much sense to me. It reads like the signal is to listen to the listening function. IMO it is clearer that the listening function is _added_ to the signal bindings.\n"

One could remove a callback by giving the callback, the callback and the context or only the context (which removes all callback for the given context, very useful as callback can be provided anonymously).\nPersonally, I never experienced the multi-context problem you were talking about.\n"

While in Chrome it is faster than `slice.call()`, it still isn't as fast as a manual copy as you originally suggested, so in that sense it isn't better. However it sure is more readable IMHO.\n"
