        "body": "Hi Adam,\n\nThanks for the quick response.\n\nFirst off I think I forgot about one other change I made when I was working\non my other changes.  It seems the code as it existed would generate the\nsame CSS classes for dimensionCssRules over and over without checking to\nsee if they already existed.  I added some logic to make it prevent\nduplicates, I figure that should make parsing the CSS rules for pages with\nlots of images more efficient and easier to debug.  This was again not\nsomething I ended up needing but just something I noticed.\n\nI think I didn't want to add to the image-set purpose because I saw it as a\nway of handling URL patterns, but for me I only have 1 url pattern so it\ndoesn't make sense to create more as the url would always be the same.  My\npattern is always \"/image/{requestWidth}w/{requestHeight}h/{imageName}\".  I\nhave it drop the requestHeight for this usage because I don't want to\nchange the aspect ratio and the resizing servlet handles that if you leave\nit as just \"h\".  I can see in other use cases that you would want to\nspecify the min/max width on the image-set if you had static files and you\nwanted it to switch from requesting file1x.png to file2x.png when the size\ngot over say 200px, so perhaps it would make sense to add that as an option\nthere two.\n\nSince the browser will not size the element based on the image-set (and I\ndon't think it should really) it makes sense to have a fallback I think to\nwhatever is in the max-width and assume that is still styling it.\n\nThe big problem I have with static requests currently is that I don't know\nthe pixel width of these images at request time on the server and thus\ncan't set the data-width and data-height to any real numbers.  Even getting\nthe aspect ratio is annoying on the server side and I'd prefer to leave\nthat to the resizing servlet if possible.\n\nThe other problem with using width as a percentage is that it doesn't seem\nto recalculate properly on resize and just uses the same size image but\nstretches it.  The percentage value gets returned as a pixel value from\ngetCalculatedStyleValue and so it never changes.\n\nSince I'm only doing a mobile site it doesn't bother me on that front\ndirectly but this means if I rotate the device it will not request the\nhigher resolution image that I would want.  I don't know a way to do it\nwith width as a percentage in css currently because it makes the value a\nfixed pixel.  Perhaps we could allow you to specify \"percentage\" or\n\"dynamic\" as the value in data-width/data-height to cause it to recalculate\nwidth based on computed width pixels every time the resize happens and not\ntreat it as a fixed pixel size.\n\nYou have any other thoughts on how to support a case where you don't know\nwhat size the image needs to be or what the aspect ratio will be when\ngenerating the HTML?\n\nThanks,\nThad\n\nOn Mon, Apr 16, 2012 at 11:57 PM, Adam Bradley <\nreply@reply.github.com\n\n> wrote:\n> \n> I've just added a demo which may help.

This is a good question, should we leaving image-set() alone and use media queries to decide different breakpoints for static images? Or should the breakpoints live within image-set().

What needs to change is after each resize foresight.js should get the image-set values again (from the font-family property because a new value would be assigned by the active media query) and recalculate. Currently it only gets the image-set values on the initial load, so any changes via media queries foresight.js does not know about. I'll log an issue.\n\nThanks for all the feedback and contributing to the project!\n"

My thinking is that unless the\npoint is to have it size whatever natural size the image is the developer\nwill specify via CSS a width (or max/min width) that should have some to\ntell the browser how wide they want it (% or px).  It seems to me that\nabsent any info in the image-set or on the element that would be the only\nplace left to look.  I went for max-width because since I don't know the\naspect ratio I just request the max width that would fit in the slot and\nfigure it will resize down on the browser if the img is too tall.\n\n> > The other problem with using width as a percentage is that it doesn't\n> > seem to recalculate properly on resize and just uses the same size image\n> > but stretches it.\n> \n> Yes this requires a fix, my most recent demo for [Static Responsive Images\n> using Media Queries](http://foresightjs.appspot.com/demos/parent-element-media-queries.html)\n> pointed that out. What needs to change is after each resize foresight.js\n> should get the image-set values again (from the font-family property\n> because a new value would be assigned by the active media query) and\n> recalculate. Currently it only gets the image-set values on the initial\n> load, so any changes via media queries foresight.js does not know about.\n> I'll log an issue.\n\nIf you don't have time to work on that now I could take a stab at it.  I\nalready worked a bunch with the loading code so it's on my mind anyway.\n But I wouldn't want to do something you were already working on so I can\nhold off if you would rather do it.  (I'd reset my fork before I did it so\nit would be easy to import without the other stuff I already did)\n\nThanks for all the feedback and contributing to the project!\n\n> No problem, thanks for getting all this stuff working, best solution out\n> there and fun to watch it re-request images as I resize the browser ;)\n> \n> ---\n> \n> Reply to this email directly or view it on GitHub:\n> https://github.com/adamdbradley/foresight.js/pull/9#issuecomment-5175742\n"

        "body": "It appears that IE8 will not allow custom events.  The only way to support it is through a hack of using a standard event and passing custom properties on the event object http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2028456/how-to-fire-personal-event-in-javascript.  The other option is to add a framework and start using their event model but that would increase the required weight.  I suggest for the time being that the events are IE9+ support only.  I'll commit code to make sure browsers that don't support custom events don't try to execute them shortly.\n"

I can do it and make a pull request if that is easier or if it's easier for you to just do it directly then I can merge whatever you do into our fork to keep them in line.  Just let me know.\n\nAlso, do you have a way that you have been compressing it that you prefer?  I used uglifyjs (http://marijnhaverbeke.nl/uglifyjs) for our local project just now and it seemed to do a better job to me then the google closure tools.  Figure it's best to keep the minify tool consistent so I can remember to do it when I do the pull requests in the future.  \n\nThanks again for making this library, it's great!\n"
