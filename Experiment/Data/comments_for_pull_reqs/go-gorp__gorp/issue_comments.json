I would suppose that if the slice's array was sent as an argument to the DB, it would work. \n\nOne could detect the type of the Go struct field and decide whether or not it was a slice via the `reflect` package.

SQLite and MySQL don't support ARRAYs as far as I know, so this feature would only be available for Postgresql.\n\nA first step that would help would be to write a .go file (perhaps as a gist) that just does a simple INSERT / UPDATE / SELECT sequence against a table that has an ARRAY field using the pql driver directly (i.e. no gorp).  That example would help me understand how this data type works and would prove that the go postgres driver supports them.\n\nOnce we have that example I suspect we could figure out how to bolt it into the SQL generator in gorp.\n\nWhat do you think?\n"

        "body": "Hi there,\n\nThe issue is that sql.Open() is failing, so the db value is nil.  Here's a few things to fix in your code:\n\n1) You need to import a database driver.  for example, change the import to:\n\n```\nimport (\n    \"database/sql\"\n    \"github.com/coopernurse/gorp\" \n    _ \"github.com/ziutek/mymysql/godrv\"\n)\n```\n\n2) You should check the error return values from various calls.  Your code was ignoring the err value from sql.Open(), so you inadvertently passed the nil db value to the gorp.DbMap.\n\n3) If you're using the mymysql driver, the sql.Open() call should look like this:\n\n```\ndb, err := sql.Open(\"mymysql\", \"dbname/myuser/mypassword\")\nif err != nil {\npanic(err)\n}\n```\n\n4) Not a clear bug, but perhaps a misunderstanding: If you define Id as a primary key, gorp will ignore the value on insert.  So the 3 you're passing in will be ignored. So it may be more clear to write:\n\n```\np1 := &Sexo{Nombre:\"otro\"}\n```\n\nor\n\n```\np1 := &Sexo{0, \"otro\"}\n```\n\n---\n\nMy working version of your program looks like this:\n\n``` go\npackage main\n\nimport (\n    \"database/sql\"\n    \"github.com/coopernurse/gorp\"\n    _ \"github.com/ziutek/mymysql/godrv\"\n)\n\nfunc main() {\n    probarGORP()\n}\n\nfunc probarGORP() {\n    // construct a gorp DbMap\n    //dbmap.TraceOn(\"\", log.New(os.Stdout, \"gorptest: \", log.Lmicroseconds))\n    db, err := sql.Open(\"mymysql\", \"pds/pds/123456\")\n    if err != nil {\n        panic(err)\n    }\n    dbmap := &gorp.DbMap{Db: db, Dialect: gorp.MySQLDialect{\"InnoDB\", \"UTF8\"}}\n    table := dbmap.AddTableWithName(Sexo{}, \"Sexo\").SetKeys(true, \"Id\")\n    table.ColMap(\"Id\").Rename(\"id\")\n    table.ColMap(\"Nombre\").Rename(\"nombre\")\n    p1 := &Sexo{Nombre:\"otro\"}\n\n    err = dbmap.Insert(p1) // Version is now 1\n    if err != nil {\n        panic(err)\n    }\n}\n\ntype Sexo struct {\n    Id     int64\n    Nombre string\n}\n```\n"

        "body": "Hi there.  Interesting idea.  I agree that many shops standardize on naming conventions like this, but I think it would be hard for us to make everyone happy.\n\nWhat if we define an interface that lets users programmatically hook the mapping sequence.\n\nSomething like:\n\n``` go\n    // not sold on this name\n    type Mapper interface {\n        // returns table name for struct i. if no change desired, implementation should return mappedName\n        TableName(i interface{}, mappedName string) string\n\n        // returns customized ColumnMap for a field\n        ColumnMap(tableName string, field reflect.Value, column ColumnMap) ColumnMap\n    }\n\n    // modify DbMap to optionally hold a Mapper\n    type DbMap struct {\n        // new field\n        mapper Mapper\n    }\n\n    // Modify DbMap.AddTableWithName() to call Mapper methods\n```\n\nWe could also provide an exported convenience function for some common things.  Like:\n\n``` go\n    // turns:  MyTable into: my_table\n    func CamelCaseToUnderscore(s string) string { }\n```\n\nAnd that would enable you to satisfy your original desire by doing something like:\n\n``` go\n    type CamelCaseMapper struct { }\n\n    func (me CamelCaseMapper) TableName(i interface{}, mappedName) {\n        return gorp.CamelCaseToUnderscore(mappedName)\n    }\n\n    func (me CamelCaseMapper) ColumnMap(tableName string, field reflect.Value, column gorp.ColumnMap) gorp.ColumnMap {\n        column.ColumnName = gorp.CamelCaseToUnderscore(column.ColumnName)\n        return column\n    }\n\n    dbmap := &DbMap{Db: db, Dialect: dialect, Mapper: mapper}\n    dbmap.AddTable(MyStruct{})\n```\n\nToo complicated?\n"

        "body": "Yes, mysql supports it, but sqlite does not.  \n\nBefore opening this issue, I tried to create a patch to go-sqlite3 that could allow Scanning into a time.Time, but I found it was not possible because sqlite does not have a real datetime type.  When scanning, we only have the driver-provided type, which is one of the values you can see in sqlite3.h: (SQLITE_INTEGER, _FLOAT, _BLOB, _NULL, _TEXT).  At the driver level, it appeared to be impossible to conditionally produce a time.Time value only if the caller is scanning into a time.Time, and a string otherwise.  \n\nThis does seem like a case that applies to sqlite but not mysql, postgres, oracle, etc, so I'm not sure if you want to provide a fix in Gorp, but it could be useful since sqlite is pretty common.\n\nThe changes to support it in Gorp seem to be:\n- Using the \"datetime\" column type for time.Time struct fields.  (Which is a valid sqlite type even though it's just sugar for string, I think)\n- When scanning into struct fields, notice that the destination struct field is a time.Time and instead scan into a string, which you then time.Time.Parse() into the time.Time. \n\n(I believe that queries that pass a time.Time as an argument may already work)\n"

I don't believe it is possible to implement the code snippet you quoted since []interface{} is not trivially convertable to a slice of any primitive type, though.  \n\nI only suggest making it possible to get the underlying sql.Transaction since that would be the easy way out -- kudos on trying to drive to a more comprehensive solution.\n"

The non-transactional impl will start a transaction and perform the two operations in a transactional context.\n\nI wonder if this is worth elevating to the Go maintainers.  The connection pool is actually implemented in the Go sql package, so the behavior you're seeing would occur with any code that simply does an Exec() and LastInsertId() call in sequence using the standard Go sql API.  Unless I'm missing something gorp isn't doing anything exotic here, and this bug could be considered a design flaw in the Go sql package.  Ideally the sql package would expose an atomic operation for the insert and get last insert id pair.\n"

For example:\n\n```\ntype Product struct {\n    Id int64 db:\"product_id,pk,autoincrement\"\n    Price int64 db:\"unit_price\"\n    IgnoreMe string db:\"-\"\n}\n```\n\nThat would follow the convention used in the `encoding/json` package (and probably others).\n\nThoughts?\n"

If we're going to just use a boolean then I'd prefer two functions:\n\n``` go\n// same behavior as current implementation\nfunc (m *DbMap) CreateTables() error { }\n\n// adds the \"if not exists\" clause\nfunc (m *DbMap) CreateTablesIfNotExists() error\n```\n\nFeel free to update your pull request, or leave a comment and I can implement this change.  \n\nAdding a test for this would be great too.\n\ncheers\n"

        "body": "Cool, here's my first take at a patch.  I renamed `x` to `bindCount` for clarity.  If there are no bound columns in the SET clause, then `bindUpdate()` doesn't compute the rest of the query. Update() will skip the SQL operation entirely when bindArgs is empty.\n\nThis still allows the pre/post update hooks to run, and provides driver independent behavior.  I noticed that if we execute a no-op sql statement in this case.e.g.: `update foo set id=id where id=?` then MySQL reports 0 rows updated, and Postgresql reports 1 row updated.\n\n``` diff\ndiff --git a/gorp.go b/gorp.go\nindex 7371ee7..c3fcd46 100644\n--- a/gorp.go\n+++ b/gorp.go\n@@ -315,17 +315,19 @@ func (t *TableMap) bindUpdate(elem reflect.Value) (bindInstance, error) {\n\n                s := bytes.Buffer{}\n                s.WriteString(fmt.Sprintf(\"update %s set \", t.dbmap.Dialect.QuoteField(t.TableName)))\n-               x := 0\n+\n+               bindCount := 0\n\n                for y := range t.columns {\n                        col := t.columns[y]\n                        if !col.isPK && !col.Transient {\n-                               if x > 0 {\n+                               if bindCount > 0 {\n                                        s.WriteString(\", \")\n                                }\n+\n                                s.WriteString(t.dbmap.Dialect.QuoteField(col.ColumnName))\n                                s.WriteString(\"=\")\n-                               s.WriteString(t.dbmap.Dialect.BindVar(x))\n+                               s.WriteString(t.dbmap.Dialect.BindVar(bindCount))\n\n                                if col == t.version {\n                                        plan.versField = col.fieldName\n@@ -333,10 +335,11 @@ func (t *TableMap) bindUpdate(elem reflect.Value) (bindInstance, error) {\n                                } else {\n                                        plan.argFields = append(plan.argFields, col.fieldName)\n                                }\n-                               x++\n+                               bindCount++\n                        }\n                }\n\n+               if bindCount > 0 {\n                        s.WriteString(\" where \")\n                        for y := range t.keys {\n                                col := t.keys[y]\n@@ -345,20 +348,21 @@ func (t *TableMap) bindUpdate(elem reflect.Value) (bindInstance, error) {\n                                }\n                                s.WriteString(t.dbmap.Dialect.QuoteField(col.ColumnName))\n                                s.WriteString(\"=\")\n-                       s.WriteString(t.dbmap.Dialect.BindVar(x))\n+                               s.WriteString(t.dbmap.Dialect.BindVar(bindCount))\n\n                                plan.argFields = append(plan.argFields, col.fieldName)\n                                plan.keyFields = append(plan.keyFields, col.fieldName)\n-                       x++\n+                               bindCount++\n                        }\n                        if plan.versField != \"\" {\n                                s.WriteString(\" and \")\n                                s.WriteString(t.dbmap.Dialect.QuoteField(t.version.ColumnName))\n                                s.WriteString(\"=\")\n-                       s.WriteString(t.dbmap.Dialect.BindVar(x))\n+                               s.WriteString(t.dbmap.Dialect.BindVar(bindCount))\n                                plan.argFields = append(plan.argFields, plan.versField)\n                        }\n                        s.WriteString(\";\")\n+               }\n\n                plan.query = s.String()\n                t.updatePlan = plan\n@@ -1384,6 +1388,7 @@ func update(m *DbMap, exec SqlExecutor, list ...interface{}) (int64, error) {\n                        return -1, err\n                }\n\n+               if len(bi.args) > 0 {\n                        res, err := exec.Exec(bi.query, bi.args...)\n                        if err != nil {\n                                return -1, err\n@@ -1404,6 +1409,7 @@ func update(m *DbMap, exec SqlExecutor, list ...interface{}) (int64, error) {\n                        }\n\n                        count += rows\n+               }\n\n                err = runHook(\"PostUpdate\", eptr, hookarg)\n                if err != nil {\n```\n"

This would be a generalization of the enhancement in #40.  \n\n`SelectInto` would be added to `SqlExecutor` so you could use it with transactions.  Example code might look like:\n\n``` go\nfunc (u *User) NumRecords(s gorp.SqlExecutor) int {\n    var count int64\n    err := s.SelectInto(&count, \"SELECT COUNT(*) as Count FROM Queue WHERE User_Id = $1\", u.Id)\n    // handle err\n    return count\n}\n```\n\nMy guess is we've got all the pieces for this in place.  It will just be a simple matter of moving them around.  :-)\n"

        "body": "Hm, I'm not sure that's relevant here -- the snippet you quote for MySQL seems like a detail of how the TIMESTAMP is stored.  For example it says that MySQL does the conversion on its end, not that the user has to.  For both TIMESTAMP and DATETIME, if you store a value and then read it back, you should read exactly what you wrote.  (That's what @coopernurse means about being symmetric).  \n\nAs to what the issue is, I don't have an idea just from reading this thread.  I would have guessed that it is an unwanted timezone conversion happening on the Go side in time.Time (I've used it a lot and still don't feel like I have a good grasp of how it handles timezones), but the Postgres test works properly, so I'm not sure.\n\nI can potentially debug it later this week (busy with the day job though)\n"

        "body": "Thanks for the thoughtful post.\n\nI like the ideas for tags.  My only initial comment is that we'd have to carefully define the enum of types that are supported.\n\nRe: Codec: there's actually a (poorly documented) solution for this in master.  See this interface:\n\n``` go\ntype TypeConverter interface {\n    // ToDb converts val to another type. Called before INSERT/UPDATE operations\n    ToDb(val interface{}) (interface{}, error)\n\n    // FromDb returns a CustomScanner appropriate for this type. This will be used\n    // to hold values returned from SELECT queries.\n    //\n    // In particular the CustomScanner returned should implement a Binder\n    // function appropriate for the Go type you wish to convert the db value to\n    //\n    // If bool==false, then no custom scanner will be used for this field.\n    FromDb(target interface{}) (CustomScanner, bool)\n}\n```\n\nAnd this example in `gorp_test.go`\n\n``` go\nfunc TestTypeConversionExample(t *testing.T) {\n    dbmap := initDbMap()\n    defer dbmap.DropTables()\n\n    p := Person{FName: \"Bob\", LName: \"Smith\"}\n    tc := &TypeConversionExample{-1, p, CustomStringType(\"hi\")}\n    _insert(dbmap, tc)\n\n    expected := &TypeConversionExample{1, p, CustomStringType(\"hi\")}\n    tc2 := _get(dbmap, TypeConversionExample{}, tc.Id).(*TypeConversionExample)\n    if !reflect.DeepEqual(expected, tc2) {\n        t.Errorf(\"tc2 %v != %v\", expected, tc2)\n    }\n\n    tc2.Name = CustomStringType(\"hi2\")\n    tc2.PersonJSON = Person{FName: \"Jane\", LName: \"Doe\"}\n    _update(dbmap, tc2)\n\n    expected = &TypeConversionExample{1, tc2.PersonJSON, CustomStringType(\"hi2\")}\n    tc3 := _get(dbmap, TypeConversionExample{}, tc.Id).(*TypeConversionExample)\n    if !reflect.DeepEqual(expected, tc3) {\n        t.Errorf(\"tc3 %v != %v\", expected, tc3)\n    }\n\n    if _del(dbmap, tc) != 1 {\n        t.Errorf(\"Did not delete row with Id: %d\", tc.Id)\n    }\n\n}\n```\n"

        "body": "The problem I have with `TypeConverter` is that it converts all types - It has to know about every type, and uses a switch-type to do the conversion. I was trying to figure out something more flexible. Something that would make each type modular and not have to be in the same package. Each type should know how to convert itself.\n\nWith `TypeCodec` I was thinking about encoding/json's Encode/Decode functions. The intent was you'd have a `TypeCodec` per type. But I thought about it more, and I like encoding/json's `type Marshaler interface` and `type Unmarshaler interface` better, so I updated the post above with that idea.\n"

        "body": "Hi,\n\nNot sure if this is relevant (and my apologies if it is not), but just for the record: the first post here seems to indicate that sqlite3 is not able to store time.Time objects natively.  Did I understand this right?  If so, this problem seems to be fixed in the mean time.  The following program successfully stores a time.Time value in an sqlite3 database for me: https://gist.github.com/seehuhn/6197736 .\n\nTimezone information is lost (i.e. the result is always int UTC), but the result after retrieval denotes the same point in time, i.e. .UnixNano() returns the same value.\n\nAll the best,\nJochen\n"

Small patch: jamesharr@6724b78be6a1f5fa1d2efdc0ac605b7101d080df\n\nReally, the option should be left up to the user, but Gorp's column mapping doesn't support that yet. Keeping the timezone in postgres works (and without timezone doesn't), so it's the safer option for the time being if you want Time object in Gorp.\n\nSome exploration of the underlying SQL drivers might be warranted as well, since there might be other intricacies that differ between SQL drivers. I know Go-SQL-Driver/MySQL has a location setting for timezones (and a pending pull request to correct conversions). Other drivers may behave differently, especially for MySQL.\n"

For example:\n\n``` go\ntype Person struct {\n    Id      int64\n    Name sql.NullString\n    Age sql.NullInt64\n}\n```\n\nName and Age can both be null in the db, and will scan properly.  You would get the value via:   person.Name.String.   \n"

It changes existing behavior, which may surprise some users, and it impacts portability.  Also, since Dialect is an interface, it's pretty easy to just make your own with this (or any other) behavior.  If you feel strongly about it, please open a separate issue for this so we can get opinions from other folks watching this repo.\n\nRe d9421a6: Looks good.  I'm going to merge this into the develop branch, which is where I'm starting to stage changes in batch before folding into master.\n\nRe 76d12f3: Good ideas here, but there's a lot of activity in this general area (2-3 other PRs).  So I'm going to hold off on this too.  I'm going to create a master ticket for the \"grand tag enhancement\" feature so we can hash out the best way to deal with this and get feedback from everyone.\n\ncheers\n"

I suppose in the struct you can at least make a new field un-exported, or add a db=\"-\" tag..\n\nWhat I've been doing is just explicitly writing out the fields, always, and it's not really so bad.  And it is the only way it could work when you select derived columns, anyway.  Maybe that is the thing that should be encouraged.. \n"

Rewriting the user-provided query string would violate expectations of any users expecting Gorp to behave like other ORMs or database libraries, and it could reduce efficiency due to the inability to reuse pre-existing prepared statements.  Implementing escaping in Go could also be less efficient and will result in challenges relating to character encodings. Using placeholders as they are designed to be used, and letting the underlying database libraries handle the details, will result in a cleaner and less surprising Gorp. \n"

Not all query strings look like \"SQL\" -- for example, ODBC drivers support bizarre operations and syntaxes, complex statements like stored procedure definitions can contain ?s unsuitable for replacement, numbered placeholders, named placeholders, Postgres array notation, embedded scripting languages could use ? as an operator, etc -- but the majority of these could be addressed if Gorp only attempts to perform these operations when they are not likely to cause issues. Implementing them on Dialect might be the right place. Another benefit of adding it to Dialect is that it becomes user-configurable.\n\nAlso, the database/sql driver Valuer interface allows slices of bytes. It is thus reasonable to allow passing a slice of bytes as a query parameter when writing queries that touch blobs. There may be other cases like this that would require special treatment, so marking the slices to expand with a wrapper might be the safest thing to do.\n\nI agree that the prepared statement cache could be added safely later.\n"

For example, in SQLite alone there appear to be 5 different types of placeholders: \nhttp://www.sqlite.org/c3ref/bind_blob.html\n\nOn the other side of the spectrum, MySQL just requires a sequence of '?' to be generated, which is absolutely trivial and which I could be pretty confident would not go wrong.\n\nWith respect to \"How do we know if it's meant to be a slice or a single valued []byte\", we could say that a list-valued parameter has to have a type marker wrapping, e.g.\n\n``` go\ntype List interface{}\n\ndbm.Select(&objs, \"select id, name from foo where id in (?)\", gorp.List(ids)) \n```\n\nShrug.

I must admit I am fairly new to golang so I might be missing something which might be obvious to you.\n\nI know that mgo provides no type safety but that is to be expected as it is working against mongodb.  \n\nHere is how hibernate manages this (by setting annotation dynamic-update for the class)\nhttp://www.mkyong.com/hibernate/hibernate-dynamic-update-attribute-example/\n\nGorp could do something similar.  However, Hibernate has a level2 cache which can be used to compare which fields are dirty to generate this.  As gorp does not have a level2 cache, I can think of 2 approaches\n\na) Compare every field against default value for that type(0 for int, empty for string etc).  If it is NOT a default, then use the property while generating the sql.  Else ignore.  \n\nb) Pass an array of struct field names as either include/exclude list like I mentioned in the original issue description) containing which attributes need to be included/excluded in the update statement.\n"

Looking over the code with my slightly less rudimentary knowledge of Go, I can see where some performance improvements could be made (e.g. if no embedded struct has been found yet, there's no reason to loop through columns looking for values to overwrite), if that's the reason that this hasn't yet been merged.  I could set up some benchmarks and try to change the code to ensure that performance isn't affected unless fields are actually being overridden.\n\nI'm currently importing our forked version of gorp in our production code at Radiobox and I'd rather not keep doing that unless I absolutely have to, so let me know if I need to make any changes.\n"

The Go (1.2) std. lib `json` implementation usage boils down to this snippet in the main `encode()` func:\n\n```\nif !fv.IsValid() || f.omitEmpty && isEmptyValue(fv) {\n  continue\n}\n```\n\nWith this `isEmptyValue` declaration:\n\n```\nfunc isEmptyValue(v reflect.Value) bool {\n  switch v.Kind() {\n  case reflect.Array, reflect.Map, reflect.Slice, reflect.String:\n    return v.Len() == 0\n  case reflect.Bool:\n    return !v.Bool()\n  case reflect.Int, reflect.Int8, reflect.Int16, reflect.Int32, reflect.Int64:\n    return v.Int() == 0\n  case reflect.Uint, reflect.Uint8, reflect.Uint16, reflect.Uint32, reflect.Uint64, reflect.Uintptr:\n    return v.Uint() == 0\n  case reflect.Float32, reflect.Float64:\n    return v.Float() == 0\n  case reflect.Interface, reflect.Ptr:\n    return v.IsNil()\n  }\n  return false\n}\n```\n\nI imagine much the same approach could be easily extending into the `bindInsert` and `bindUpdate` gorp methods, right alongside the `Transient` checks (just as json.decode cares not a blip about \"omitempty\", I don't believe it's relevant to bindGet, or bindDelete, for that matter).\n\nThe #92 functionality would be cool, but more complex than this particular problem calls for, and this issue has a clear precedent in the std. lib.\n"

(The folding of unquoted names to lower case in PostgreSQL is incompatible with the SQL standard, which says that unquoted names should be folded to upper case.

I think it makes total sense to also lowercase it automatically in a library, even just for PostgreSQL dialect.\n\nAlthough quoting it would work, but then you'd have to be aware of the fact that when running normal SQL commands and writing SQL files by hand outside of gorp, you have to quote all the generated fields and table names too. IMHO, that's something a seasoned PostgreSQL user probably do not want to be doing.\n\nIt is not hard (quoting all names), but I think mapping field names to the underscore convention might be the better, if not the more common, approach.\n\ni.e. `helloWorld -> hello_world`\n\nalso feels much easier to type than a pair of quotes for me.\n"

I see no reason to keep them around unless you want to continue supporting Go versions <1.0.  And even then, I would think you could just make a go0 git tag (assuming this even worked prior to Go 1):\n\n\"When checking out or updating a package, get looks for a branch or tag that matches the locally installed version of Go. The most important rule is that if the local installation is running version \"go1\", get searches for a branch or tag named \"go1\". If no such version exists it retrieves the most recent version of the package.\"\n"

What you currently have makes the least sense to me, since it completely prevents tables with upper-case characters from being used.  The first behaviour has in my experience been used the most, so my vote goes for that one.\n\nI also see other problems with the quoting:\n- Double quotes are not escaped correctly.  They should be escaped by doubling the quote character, e.g. this is what pq does: ``\"` + strings.Replace(name, `\"`, `\"\"`, -1) + `\"``.\n- In QuotedTableForQuery, the schema name should be quoted as well.  It is an identifier and follows the same rules as the table name.\n"

Using the conventional DbMap.Select() method resulted in memory usage around 7.5Gb whereas by returning each row on the channel, memory usage sits around 180Mb. \n\nAlso this is in addition to the accepted result structures that DbMap.Select() accepts. It just means that it will identify a channel being passed in that meets the criteria which will then prompt a stream type response. If you pass in the pointer to a slice, it still writes to that entirely before completing, as it did before I added this.\n"

        "body": "I think this is a bug.  `SelectOne` is calling `hookedselect` which calls `rawselect` which assumes a list return.  Line 1467 creates a new struct to bind into: `v := reflect.New(t)`\n\nAnd then line 1326 of `SelectOne` binds the returned element to the pointer passed to it: `dest.Elem().Set(src.Elem())`\n\nThat explains the behavior you're seeing -- your pointer now points to a new struct, so the transient fields are zeroed out.  And I would agree that behavior is unexpected.\n\nNot sure what the easiest fix is.  One possibility might be to define a new interface for appending results and pass an instance of that to `rawselect` instead of `i interface{}`.  This would let us clean up the `appendToSlice`, `intoStruct` flags.  `SelectOne` would provide an implementation that appends to the pointer passed in, and errors out if more than one row is found.\n\nSorry I don't have an easy solution for this, but this is a good ticket and one that could prompt some code re-work that will have some other hygenic benefits.\n"

Also, splitting up gorp.go, while probably long overdue, is something I'd want to do in a PR on its own since it makes it hard for me to merge any other pending PRs.\n\nSo I'm wondering if we can split this work up into smaller PRs:\n- #158 changes - I'm guessing this is a pretty small change and easy merge\n- #157 changes - Probably bigger - hard for me to tell given the large number of commits here\n- gorp.go split \n\nDo you have time/interest to work together on that?  Thanks again.\n"

This issue would depend on resolution of #164  Then you could do something like:\n\n``` go\n\ntype Group struct {\n    Id string \n    //  not sure how you're mapping this, I'm assuming it's wired manually\n    User User  `db:\"-\"`\n}\n\nfunc (me *Group) PostGet(ex SqlExecutor) error {\n  if me.User.Id == \"\" {\n     me.User.Group = *me\n     return ex.SelectOne(&me.User, \"select * from User where GroupId=?\", me.Id)\n  }\n  return nil\n}\n\ntype User struct {\n    Id string\n    Group Group  `db:\"-\"`\n}\n\nfunc (me *User) PostGet(ex SqlExecutor) error {\n  if me.Group.Id == \"\" {\n     me.Group.User = *me\n     return ex.SelectOne(&me.Group, \"select * from Group where UserId=?\", me.Id)\n  }\n  return nil\n}\n```\n\nWould that work?  Again, due to #164 that code won't work today, but once fixed it should work.\n"

        "body": "The implementation here is somewhat problematic. Something I didn't realize when I submitted the patch is that the \"on duplicate key update\" directive in MySQL will update an existing tuple on any duplicate index, not just primary key. This seems very suspect and weird. I would have thought this would apply only to primary key. Now to be fair, there may not be a primary key for a table. Still, it's very counter intuitive that this updates an existing tuple on a non-primary index have a duplicate entry instead of returning an error.\n\nI realize it does have mysql-specific behavior, but I thought that's what the dialect code paths were for?\n\nI've had to revert to code which instead does a get for the tuple and then either an insert or update as appropriate. I needed the original value in any case, so it was a palatable solution. The upsert still seems like it has value however, and I'm continuing to use it in other places. I'm not sure about other ORMs, but the other pattern I have seen in code to handle the upsert case is to try an update then fall back to an insert.\n\nI think \"merge\" would be a bad name for what this is doing as the SQL ANSI merge details are very complex and over designed. This functionality would have to be modified from what's there now. \"Upsert\" seems to be a much more \"standardized\" term for this pattern.\n"

        "body": "@coopernurse @robfig Why do you consider not returning an error if you don't have a place for a returned column \"bad\"? There's a very clear way to proceed if you have more columns than you need: just ignore the extra ones. I can only see one possible downside to this: It could potentially hide bugs in your code, during development. You might be wondering why a certain struct field is not being filled, and gorp would give you no reason as to why. In development, returning an error might be preferable. \n\nBut in production, returning an error (and halting the table mapping) is terrible! It means that if programmers aren't careful with every sql query they write, it could cause production downtime in between db migrations and code pushes. I think this is unacceptable, and I have a simple solution:\n\nFor the case of \"more columns than you need\", gorp would try to map the rest of the columns onto the struct and at the end, return a different type of error-implementing struct that could be checked in the application code and ignored if desired.\n"

        "body": "Always quoting makes sense, but lowering case seems like a setting that should be made configurable. Although lowercase identifiers are prevalent in the community, the Postgres documentation is not prescriptive about this. Mixed case identifiers can exist.\n\nI understand the convenience behind https://github.com/coopernurse/gorp/issues/21, but it breaks mixed-case identifiers. There's at least one example in the standard library that has taken the opposite approach: [encoding/json](http://golang.org/pkg/encoding/json/). Convential JSON property names are either camel case or lowercase with underscores. To get either of those from a struct with exported fields, an explicit `json:\"fieldName\"` or `json:\"field_name\"` tag must be added.\n\nAny other comments from Postgres users?\n"

I wouldn't mind adding official contributors to it (esp @sqs who has already contributed a lot), especially if the decision was made to mothball gorp.\n\nHowever, I have to warn upfront that although Modl is a fork of Gorp, it wasn't forked in order to continue maintenance on Gorp.  The main goals were a cleanup of Gorp's API and an internal rewrite to base some of its database code on sqlx instead.  Part of this was that Gorp's original CRUD API (before @robfig's changes) was somewhat un-go-like (no pointer passing, so lots of casting), and part was that I wanted to test an assumption I had which was that sqlx was suitable as a substrate for other ORM designers and could allow them to skip reinventing db<->struct serialization.\n\nSo, while modl maintains a lot of the feel and structure of gorp, it does dispense with a few things that gorp does and it behaves slightly differently out of the box.  For a project starting out there's almost no difference;  if you're running something large in production there are behavioral differences which the compiler will not notify you about, and some things (purposefully) missing from it that some Gorp users might potentially rely on. \n"

We've also deprecated the `develop` branch, but you should be able to rebase on `master` without any problems.\n\nWe will split the code in separate files once the open PR's are closed.\n"

Notice how json will not return an error and will not serialize the conflicting names: http://play.golang.org/p/uvBhGEk2RJ\n\nThis problem could use some more thinking on; my gut instinct is to match the `encoding/json` package's behavior as it would follow the principle of least surprise.\n"

        "body": "In case it helps, I've got a [project (which I've named gorq)](https://github.com/nelsam/gorq), which imports and extends gorp's functionality with a query DSL.  It was built to handle some of these sorts of issues (the whole project stems from a function I wrote to generate column names for use in queries).  It's new, kind of complicated, doesn't have the most useful error messages, needs some cleanup, and the test coverage isn't very solid yet; but it's being used actively on at least four projects (all of which are using postgresql).\n\nThe basic syntax of queries becomes (as an example):\n\n``` go\ntype Foo struct {\n  ID int\n  Bar Bar `db:\"bar_id\"` // Bar.ID populated with bar_id using sql.Scanner or a TypeConverter\n  Baz string\n}\n\nfoos := []Foo{}\nref := Foo{}\nerr := dbMap.Query(&ref).\n  Where().\n  Equal(&ref.Baz, \"public\").\n  SelectToTarget(&foos)\n```\n\nIt uses references quite a bit for figuring out column names (for input values, it will usually use the column name of a field if the value is equal to a field's address), which isn't exactly ideal... but I couldn't think of anything better at the time.  Still, it's a start.\n\nMore complicated queries (e.g. needing `OR` in the where clause, or using joins) are supported, but the syntax isn't always as clean as the above.  For example:\n\n``` go\nfoos = []Foo{}\nerr = dbMap.Query(&ref).\n  Join(&ref.Bar).On().\n  Equal(&ref.Bar, &ref.Bar.ID).\n  Where().\n  Greater(&ref.Bar.Rank, 3).\n  SelectToTarget(&foos)\n\nfoos = []Foo{}\nfilter := filters.Or(filters.Equal(&ref.Bar, someAdminBarID), filters.Equal(&ref.Baz, \"public\"))\nerr = dbMap.Query(&ref).\n  Where(filter).\n  SelectToTarget(&foos)\n```\n\nI really wanted to have better test coverage before mentioning it to anyone else ... but I thought it might help anyone who's running in to this issue, and I can't hide forever.\n\nBy the way, my two cents, for what they're worth: `select *` is code smell, and discarding data (even via an option that defaults to off) is dangerous.  But my opinion's probably obvious from the fact that I wrote a pretty massive extension to gorp, in part to avoid using `select *`.\n"

However, just wanted to mention, the `TypeDef` method implements an interface that I haven't quite made a PR for yet, but it's only used during a `CREATE TABLE` statement (or during automated migration, which is yet another PR I haven't made yet).  As long as your column is already defined properly, this _should_ work for `geography` types (I didn't feel like fiddling with `geometry` types, although I'm sure the solution is similar).\n\nhttps://github.com/nelsam/gorq/blob/master/extensions/postgis.go\n\nFeel free to copy whatever code you can make use of, or just import the package and use it from there.  If you want to import the package and use the query language I've implemented in my little extension, the syntax of querying using radius values is something like:\n\n``` go\ntype someModel struct {\n  SomeGeoField extensions.Geography\n}\n\ngorqMap := &gorq.DbMap{DbMap:*dbMap}\nm := someModel{}\ng := extensions.Geography{Lat: someLat, Lng: someLng}\nresults, err := gorqMap.Query(&someModel).\n  Where().\n  Filter(extensions.WithinMeters(&someModel.SomeGeoField, g, 50).\n  OrderBy(extensions.Distance(&someModel.SomeGeoField, g), \"ASC\").\n  Select()\n```\n"

Although I'm thinking about what would happen when more options are added.\n\nWhat if we define the tag to be something like this:\n\n```\nTag = Name { ','  }\nOption = OptionKey [ ':' OptionValue ]\n```\n\nA valid `OptionKey` would be `size`. Code would look like this:\n\n``` go\ntype SomeTable struct {\n    Firstname string `db:\"firstname,size:1024\"`\n}\n```\n\nImplementation could be a simple `for _, option := range cArguments[1:]`, then split on \":\", then a `switch` on optionKey.\n\nWhat do you think @qrawl @nelsam ?\n"

For starters, a primary key constraint in SQL Server is implemented as an index and an index in SQL Server has a maximum of 900 bytes as the sum of the field lengths of the index. \n\nThe second reason is that an index in SQL Server is implemented as a B-Tree of data pages that can contain 8K of data each. An nvarchar(max) field can contain up to 1.2GB of data, which is realized as a separate linked list of data pages. So your \"field\" in the table is actually a pointer to another linked list.\n\nNow technically, it doesn't make much sense to index a long string blob. it makes a lot more sense to store a hash like sha1 generated from the string and index that. \n\nFor gorp I think it is acceptable to have to specify a max string length if you want to index the field. \n"

It allows for a _lot_ more flexibility, especially for situations where someone needs an option that the library won't support natively (for example, if someone needs an option that isn't useful in any database engine other than the one they're using, it might not be something we want to add to gorp directly).  It also just helps reduce code bloat as we add more options to the library.\n\nGranted, that may be something for another PR, later on.  Thoughts?\n"

Furthermore, even if you set your session's `statement_timeout` outside of a transaction, Go's `database/sql` library uses a connection pool under the covers - meaning that the next SQL statement will most likely execute in a different connection (and, therefore, a different session which probably doesn't have the statement_timeout set).  What you probably want to do:\n\n``` go\n// Errors ignored for brevity; don't ignore the errors in production code\ntx, _ := dbmap.Begin() // A transaction is guaranteed to be run in the same session\n_, _ = tx.Exec(\"SET STATEMENT_TIMEOUT TO 1\")\nres, _ := tx.Get(new(Person{}), someID)\np := res.(*Person)\n```\n\nIf you wanted to set the timeout on the PreGet method (and ensure that a person is never loaded outside of a transaction):\n\n``` go\nfunc (p *Person) PreGet(exec gorp.SqlExecutor) error {\n    tx, ok := exec.(*gorp.Transaction)\n    if !ok {\n        return errors.New(\"Cannot get a Person outside of a transaction\")\n    }\n    if _, err := tx.Exec(\"SET SESSION STATEMENT_TIMEOUT TO 1\"); err != nil {\n        return err\n    }\n    return nil\n}\n```\n"

You could also make `helpers.New(tx *gorp.Transaction)` as a constructor for your helper type.\n\nHowever, remember that Go isn't an object-oriented language, so it doesn't _always_ make sense to make a type just for some methods.  For example, instead of your `GetUserById` logic being a method on a struct, it _might_ make sense to move it to a function:\n\n``` go\n//in helper\n// Note: \"tx *gorp.Transaction\" could be rewriten \"exec gorp.SqlExecutor\" if you don't need to\n// restrict UserById to execute only on transactions.\nfunc UserById(tx *gorp.Transaction, id int64) *models.User{\n    p, err := tx.Get(models.User{}, id)\n    if err != nil || p == nil {\n        return nil\n    }\n    return p.(*models.User)\n}\n//in controller\nreturn helpers.UserById(id)\n```\n\nHowever, I have no knowledge of other things your helper is doing, so I don't know if that's necessarily correct for your use case.\n"

        "body": "That sounds fine.  It's always a game of weighing lines of code against ease of understanding - do whatever reads easiest/cleanest to you.\n\nAs far as what reads cleanly to me (these are personal preferences, mostly, so I'm not trying to claim that you should follow them):\n1. `Get` is kinda unnecessary in the function/method name, to my mind.  It's implied by the fact that the function returns a value.\n   1. I like to look at the full function signature.  If the function name is repeating information I already know from the parameters or return values, it's not really necessary in the name.\n   2. There are exceptions.  For example, with `UserByID` and `UserByEmail`, they need to be named two different things.  So even though the function signature makes it obvious that they're querying by ID and email (respectively), it makes sense to include that in the function name, too.\n2. If you use `golint`, it will complain if you use `Id` instead of `ID`.\n3. I kinda like providing a \"constructor\", because `helpers.New(tx)` reads cleaner to me than `helpers.Helper{tx}`.\n\nI'm going to close this issue, since you've gotten your code working.\n"

For example:\n\n``` go\ntype Foo struct {\n    Bacon string // this is tableMap.Colums[0] for the Bar type\n    Eggs int64 // this is tableMap.Columns[1] for the Bar type\n}\n\ntype Bar struct {\n    Foo // this is reflect.TypeOf(Bar{}).Field(0)\n    Toast float32 // this is tableMap.Columns[2] and reflect.TypeOf(Bar{}).Field(1)\n}\n```\n\nI'm undecided on whether or not you should rely on the column order, so I guess (at least for now) I would say you should consider it an implementation detail.  @GeertJohan do you have any thoughts?\n"

I don't think I've implemented `returning`, but it's a relatively simple update.  If you're interested in checking it out, it's currently [here](http://github.com/nelsam/gorq).\n"

I wouldn't recommend using the master branch in production or any other software that should be stable. We're going to clean up the codebase and work towards v2 on the master branch. v1 won't change in the meantime.\n\nSqlite doesn't enforce the size set to varchar(N), according to the docs a varchar(50) could contain 10-milion chars. If you need enforced size, I suggest doing this manually at application level.\n\nI assume this answers your question.

But I found that there is no convenient way to write to logs in which context the test failed.\n\ngoconvey doesn't support contexts out of the box, but it's very easy to add them manually. However, then also the context is not displayed in the `go test` results. Could be done by adding a prefix on each context that is used..\n\nSo, I'm still not really satisfied with either solution..\nWhat we could do too is using any of these above without requiring multiple contexts/dialects in the testing code. Then we'll add a tasks script (I like [slurp](https://github.com/omeid/slurp)) that runs the tests one time for each database we have. We'll need to be able to change the connection string for databases anyway, no-one has the same testing environment, so why bother with contexts IN the tests?\n\n((Sidenote: I would like to have a slurp tasks script anyway to setup and test with databases in docker containers. That should make it really easy to setup, test and destroy with most databases without installing them on the local machine.))\n\nI've created a tmp repo for these tryouts: https://github.com/GeertJohan/gorp-tests\n"

I'll just handle this in our code, but it would be nice if this could exist in gorp. I don't really expect this code to exist in gorp, however, as it involves making choices about the SQL driver libraries supported.\n"

This PR may break existing projects which use Postgres, because table name and column name are no longer lower case by default.\n\nTo use lower case table name in Postgres, do something like this: dbmap.AddTableWithName(Post{}, \"posts\")\n\nTo use lower case field name in Postgres, specify the field name in type definition: type Post struct { Title string `db:\"title\"` }\n\n I have a little to submit to make benchmark work for postgres. \n"

        "body": "TL;DR: \n- best pratice: `TypeConverter` or `Value() / Scan()` implementation in gorp?\n- how to deal with postgres specific `json` and `jsonb` features? using gorp?\n- what about documenting this trendy use case more thoroughly?\n\nThe documentation and tests presents different possible approaches to achieve this:\n1. \"TypeConverter\": https://github.com/go-gorp/gorp/blob/master/gorp_test.go#L285\n2. Valuer / Scan : https://github.com/go-gorp/gorp/blob/master/gorp_test.go#L127 although in this case, its just a matter of storing the `Person.Id` in the `Invoice` struct rather than the whole attributes.\n\nIn the first example, the `Person` struct is being converted in and out the database, using a `string` type transport (called `holder`) containing its JSON representation. \n\nHowever: \n- obviously, json encoding constraints apply, `map[int]xxx` is not supported for instance\n- the column type in the database is the dialect specific equivalent of \"string\" (`text` ...)\n- if using postgres, the column is not set to `json` of `jsonb`, making it less interesting than it could be (see http://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.4/static/datatype-json.html)\n- the type conversion might not work if the json-converted type is deeply nested in a join query\n\nPostgres JSON features are getting better and more popular with each release, from 9.3 to the latest 9.5.  In addition to being able to return a traditional dataset as a JSON representation using `row_as_json`, `json_obect_agg`, ... functions, it is also possible to store JSON as is, and yet be able to perform performant queries, such as `SELECT Id, PersonJSON->>'Fname' as Name FROM TypeConversionExample` if the `PersonJSON` column was set as `jsonb`.\n\n@jmoiron 's \"sqlx\" features a `JSONText` type to deal with this (https://github.com/jmoiron/sqlx/blob/master/types/types.go), with some upstream potential bugs however (see https://github.com/golang/go/issues/13905) and the same question as this one in its own issues: https://github.com/jmoiron/sqlx/issues/133\n\nAs a conclusion, a possible approach could be: \n1. write structs `People` and `TypeConversionExample` embedding `People`\n2. write typeconverters or value/scan functions, to convert People via a json.RawMessage derived struct\n3. create tables, either manually with SQL or via gorp then manually ALTER to specify the `person` column type as `json`(`b`)\n4. profit!\n"

Really good ideas here but I just hated that I was required to go back and alter the table to set the column type to jsonb.\n\nMy solution was to use embedding to extend gorp.PostgresDialect as follows:\n\n```\n// PostgresJSONDialect adds the JSON data types to the PostgrestDialect\ntype PostgresJSONDialect struct {\n    gorp.PostgresDialect\n}\n\n// ToSqlType returns the SQL column type for the given Go type\nfunc (d PostgresJSONDialect) ToSqlType(val reflect.Type, maxsize int, isAutoIncr bool) string {\n    // Force JSONText to use sqlType: JSONB\n    if val == reflect.TypeOf(JSONText{}) {\n        return \"JSONB\"\n    }\n    return d.PostgresDialect.ToSqlType(val, maxsize, isAutoIncr)\n}\n```\n\nVery clean and I brought the JSONText struct over from @jmoiron 's \"sqlx\".  Haven't fully tested with that struct but once I get the other side of this project working, I'll decide if it meets the need or if I need to roll my own.  But - I love that this is a minor passthrough that lets \n\n```\nerr = Dbmap.CreateTablesIfNotExists()\n```\n\ndo what it needs to do without any post-creation cleanup.\n"

        "body": "Putting our tests in a separate package allows us to more accurately gauge how our library feels for clients. It helps us catch stutter like `mysql.NewMysqlDialect()` (as an example).  Also, if we need access to unexported code in order to prove that our library is correct, it implies that we're not exporting things that should be exported.\n\nAs a side note: putting tests in a test package doesn't prevent you from also putting tests in the non-test package.  I prefer to start with a test package and only add tests in the non-test package when I really need it. I've found that the only times I've needed access to unexported code were when I had poorly architected my system.\n"

Whenever select parent is called gorp knows that the []child is fulfilled from the table child_of_parent.\r\n\r\nOr, optionally, because that would require each Child entry to be directly related to one Parent, including a matching parameter that pulls all children that have a value that matches in a particular column and fill the internal slice with that.\r\n\r\n```\r\nlist := &Parent{}\r\ndbMap.SetSelectChild(list.Children, \"select * from child_of_parent where Name = ?\", \"testChild\")\r\ndbMap.Select(list, \"select * from parent where Name = ?\", \"testParent\")\r\n```\r\nThough that would be quite like a normal two line anyway.\r\n\r\nNot sure how gorp would implement that idiomatically, just spit balling.

Prove that `rows == nil` is *never* `true`.  This may be possible by linking to code in `database/sql`, but I want tests that trigger every possible error from the underlying sql library.\r\n3. Show that this is a better solution than having SQL drivers (`lib/pq` et. al.) close `rows` if an error occurs.\r\n\r\nIt's also worth noting that [the examples in the docs](https://golang.org/pkg/database/sql/#DB.Query) check the error before deferring the call to `Close()`."

We weren't getting the error for other users who had a smaller set of rows. When we deleted 95% of the rows for the affected user, their queries started completing normally again. So it really looks like that query was timing out, but giving us `sql: no rows` instead of the timeout error."

Postgres is *much* closer to the SQL spec than MySQL and SQLite (SQLite seems to base its dialect off of MySQL's for compatibility reasons), so if one of them is violating the spec, it's nearly always MySQL/SQLite.  Based on a quick scan of the dialects, it looks like `?` will work with MySQL/SQLite/SQLServer, while postgres uses `$%d` and oracle uses `:%d`.\r\n\r\nSee [this](https://github.com/go-gorp/gorp/blob/master/gorp_test.go#L1382) for an example of using the dialect.\r\n\r\nFor the moment, I'm fine with the test as is.  If you feel like updating your test to use the dialect, feel free to send another PR; otherwise, I'll see if I can find some time to get to it."

See discussion [here](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/7333524/how-can-i-insert-many-rows-into-a-mysql-table-and-return-the-new-ids).\r\n\r\nSQLite is similar, IIUC.\r\n\r\nAs is almost always the case, Postgres [gets this right](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/5875953/returning-multiple-serial-values-from-posgtres-batch-insert).\r\n\r\n"
