        "body": "I just thought of a different way to approach it. It is based on how\nsuperscrollorama's pinning works, but instead of letting the plugin do the\ncalculations, your own script can do it.\n\nSo how it would work is you put on big empty div on the page. Then all your\nelements are on top of it, with absolute positioning. As you scroll the\ndig, you animate the elements in one big timeline that is attached to the\nscroll positioning of your big empty div. Does that make sense? You aren't\npinning. You are using the big empty div like a puppetmaster for the rest\nof the content on the page.\n\nOn Thursday, August 16, 2012, chrisi51 wrote:\n\n> ok, i found out, that scrollTo is used to calculate the max scrolling\n> value, thats why you cant scroll down that far in superscrollorama. now\n> i've disabled that maximumcalculating by an own setting in scrollTo and let\n> it jump to coordinates calculated on the fly instead of jumping to the ids.\n> \n> superscrollorama seems not to work, when u scroll very fast. it mixes the\n> different slides and pinups so that u have to scroll t othe very top to get\n> everything cleared.\n> \n> just try to the navigation on the right and scroll some arround. u will\n> see the bug than.\n> \n> \u2014\n> Reply to this email directly or view it on GitHubhttps://github.com/johnpolacek/superscrollorama/issues/6#issuecomment-7780755.\n\n## \n\n*\n*\n_Follow me on Twitter: http://twitter.com/johnpolacek_\n"

The problem I expect is that of making sure the \"updated\" tweens, that may now replace their old counterparts, \"understand\" in what state they should be initiated as, but I might be over cautious.\n\nAnother solution might be to try to convince the greensock-guys to add the capability of using functions as css attribute definers.

I added <code>tween.invalidate();</code> before the updateTo tween. This only works if you resize the window when the tween hasn't started yet, otherwise you get strange positioning.\n\nIs there anyway to get this to work on a whole set of tweens in a timeline?\n\nhttp://jsfiddle.net/RuVxr/7/\n"

I'd prefer that the tweens automaticaly scroll to their position. I dont want the user have to scroll the good position so that they can read the text. Id' prefer to have a normal tween, but when i use normal, it seems to be so many bugs when fast scrolling ...\n\nDamn.\n"

        "body": "Hi,\n\nIf you use some Pins functions, that will modify the global height of your document when you scroll, you will need to reclaculate the reall value of the scrollto.\n\nFor example:\nA site contains 3 sections.\nYour are on the top of the page (1rst section), and you want to click a link to scrollto the 3rd section.\nUnfortunaly, you added a pin function to the second section.\nSo when you click the link, at this time, the scrolltop value of the 3rd section is simply $('#3rd_section').offset().top;\nWhen the scrolling arrives on the 2cnd section, the pin function will apply, and the second section height will change. So the 3rd section top values will changes.\nTo fix it, you have to calculate the real top position of the 3rd section, which is:\n$('#first_section').height() + $('#2cnd_section #container_div').height()\n\nHope it helps.\nCheers\n"

Soit.\nVu que superscrollorama modifie la hauteur des barres au fur et \u00e0 mesure que l'on scroll, on peut tr\u00e8s bien ajouter une fonction, qui, chaque fois que l'on va scroller un peu, va r\u00e9cup\u00e9rer la hauteur ACTUELLE de chaque barre.\nA partir de la hauteur de cette barre, on va calculer le pourcentage associ\u00e9.\n\nPour faire le calcul, on a besoin de savoir combien une barre fera de pixels pour un pourcentage \u00e0 1000%.\nDans ton exemple, sur ton site, la barre pour 1000% fait environ 300 pixels. L\u00e0 encore, j'ai calcul\u00e9 la maxHeight en faisant un produit en croix. Je me suis servi de ta premi\u00e8re barre pour connaitre cette valeur.\n\nEn effet, ta premi\u00e8re barre, une fois d\u00e9pli\u00e9e, fait 287px de haut pour 943%\n\nAdmettons donc que pendant le scroll, pendant que la barre est en train de changer de hauteur, la hauteur de la barre fait \u00e0 un certain moment, par exemple 90px (je donne une valeur au hasard, mais chaque fois que tu scroll, on va en r\u00e9cup\u00e9rer une)\nEt bien si la barre fait 90px, on peut tr\u00e8s bien r\u00e9cup\u00e9rer le pourcentage associ\u00e9, gr\u00e2ce au produit en croix, soit donc:\n90 \\* 943 / 287 = 296%\nPour une hauteur de barre de 90px, le pourcentage associ\u00e9 sera 296%\n\nSi j'ai calcul\u00e9 la valeur maxHeight, c'\u00e9tait pour avoir une valeur de r\u00e9f\u00e9rence, pour pouvoir faire le produit en croix.\nMais ta valeur de r\u00e9f\u00e9rence peut tr\u00e8s bien \u00eatre la valeur finale de la barre en question, comme expliqu\u00e9 ci-dessus.\nPrendre 287px de haut pour 943% comme valeur de r\u00e9f\u00e9rence \u00e9quivaut \u00e0 prendre 1000 \\* 943 / 287 = 304px de haut pour 1000%\n\nUne fois que tu as de quoi faire un produit en croix, il te suffit de r\u00e9cup\u00e9rer la haueteur de la barre quand tu scroll, faire ton produit en croix, et injecter la nouvelle valeur en % dans la div appropri\u00e9e.\n\nFaut pas que tu recopie mon code, faut que tu comprenne ce que je t'explique, et que tu adaptes ;)\n"

The total duration of timeline is 6 seconds.\n\nWhen I set scroll duration of superscrollorama to 600 px, it's like this:\n- scrolled to 600px = 100% = 6 seconds\n- scrolled to 200px = 33.33% = 2 seconds\n- scrolled to 50px = 8.33% = 0.5 second\n\nCheck out a website where I used this awesome plugin! ;) http://carlaine.com/en\n"

        "body": "Hi Aston and thank you for your message.\nThe reason for this phenomenon I believe to be the following:\nIt stop's working at the PIN IT section, when using the scrollbar.\nIn the current version of superscrollorama we introduced a new variable \"pushFollowers\" for pins, that defaults to true, reflecting the previous behaviour.\nWhen superscrollorama reaches a point where something needs to be pinned a spacer is expanded to \"push down\" following elements. This results in a change of the scale of the scrollbar.\nYou can observe this by looking at the scrollbar's size, when scrolling down using the mouswheel.\nThis change in scale, when reaching the pin-point results in a jump, as you are dragging the scrollbar.\n\nI already talked with John about a solution to this. To my mind the solution would be that the spacer should be expanded right from the beginning for pinned elements that \"push\" followers.\nThe reason we didn't implement this is that is rather complicated.\nFirst of all the spacer size changes, depending wether it should include the pinned element's size (when pinned) or not (when pinned). Secondly the spacer's position within the dom must change. (after the pin element, when before pinning, before the pin element after pinning.) And this in turn raises another issue as the spacer is also used to \"remember\" the original position of the pinned element.\n\nYou see we are aware of this issue and are considering how to resolve it. A solution could be to add another spacer after the pinned element, but we'd like to avoid adding elements to the dom if it's possible.\n\nFor now you can avoid this \"bug\" by setting \"pushFollowers\" to false and adding a large enough container after the pinned element. This way the body size doesn't change and you avoid the bug alltogether.\n\nregards,\nJan\n"

You just define different offsets for them.\n\nThe other is using TimelineMax.\nJust create a new TimelineMax Object, and add two TweenMax Objects to it (one going to x, one going back).\nThen add the TimelineMax Object using superscrollorama.\nCheck greensock Docs for more info: http://api.greensock.com/js/com/greensock/TimelineLite.html#add()\n\nhope that helps.\n\nregards,\nJan\n"

        "body": "Hi!\n\nIt's kinda difficult to answer your questions without having seen the code.\nLet's see if I may understand correctly. though.\nIf you scroll a scrollcontainer using iScroll and in that container there is an element that is fixed, it will be scrolled out of view. The reason for that is the same why I described the pinned elements require a workaround.\nIt is due to a bug when using webkit-transform and fixed child elements.\nSee the [mobile docs](http://johnpolacek.github.com/superscrollorama/simpledemo_mobile.html) for details.\n\nAs far as I understand it there are two solutions for your problem:\n1st: (probably the better one) place your fixed item outside of the scrollwrapper. If it's supposed to be fixed all the time anyway this shouldn't be a problem.\n2nd: change useTransform to false for iScroll, as described in the mobile docs. But if you already fighting performance issues this might not be a good way to go...\n\nhope this helps.\n\nregards,\nJan\n"

(should you tween its position).\n\nregardless: I can't find any errors in the superscrollorama code.\nIf come to the conclusion that it is the reason for your project breaking, please send me a demo link.\n\nI will be gone from the computer until sunday though.\n"

If it doesn't it obviously has nothing to do with superscrollorama, but with TweenMax.\nI also suspect this to be the case here.\nSo please try to just get the animation working and when it does add it to the pin.\nIf it works in FF but breaks when you pin it, please write again.\nIf not please seek help in the [GSAP Support Forum](http://forums.greensock.com/forum/11-animation-tweening-js/).\n\nregards,\nJan\n"

Do you care to elaborate?\n\nAs to your code it looks good on the first glance.\nI have suggested previously that a good way of debugging is just defining the tween without adding it to superscrollorama. Then check accross all browsers if the animation runs as expected. If not the fault lies with TweenMax and should be discussed in its [forums](http://forums.greensock.com/forum/11-animation-tweening-js/).\nIf the error only occurs in Superscrollorama I'd like to ask you to provide a demo link where I can have a look at the issue.\n\nbest regards,\nJan\n"

That would explain why the page scroll event doesn't fire (and thus superscrollorama doesn't get updated).\n\nPlease try this:\nLook at the \"setScrollContainerOffset\" method of superscrollorama in the [documentation](http://johnpolacek.github.io/superscrollorama/).\nThen add a function that fires on Move or Update or whatever tweenlitemouswheel probably fires constantly and update the scroll position manually.\n\nhope this helps :)\n\nbest regards,\nJan\n"

It's a bit complicated to explain but long story short here's how you can make it work:\n\nEither have the positioning set to auto or wrap it inside another div that is positioned auto and pin that. The result should be the same. The outer div can be positioned relative or absolute (with top=auto).\n\nI have a list of examples of the ways elements can be pinned. I will post it in the near future.\n\nI hope that helps.\n\nregards,\nJan\n\nP.S.: Sorry for the late answer, I was on vacation.\n"

There should be no problem.\nIf your problem is that #page2 does not scroll up before the pin ends that means that you have \"pushFollowers\" set to true.\nThe solution is to make the space between the two manually. This means, make #page1, then a spacer (say 1000px height) and then #page2.\nThen make the Pin for #page1 2000px long and be sure to set \"pushFollowers\" to false \u2013> voila.\n\nbest regards,\nJan\n"

Then animate it using addTween, but set the Tween duration to 0, which will result in it not beeing linked to the scroll speed. It will always play out at the same speed you set using TweenMax.\nThe user will still skip it when he scrolls past the pin area, but the animation speed should be fine.\nAnd personally I wouldn't restrict your user beeing able to scroll until he saw all your animation. If he doesn't want to see it, he doesn't want to see it. If he does, he'll go back up. :)\n\nregards,\nJan\n"

I am sorry to tell you that this is a rather advanced plugin.\nBefore you start playing around with it you should familiarize yourself with jQuery and TweenMax or this won't be the last roadblock you hit.\nYour sample code would actually be working - it would fade out a div with the id \"y\", once you scroll past it.\nSo what you need in your DOM for any kind of effect is a div like this:\n`<div id=\"y\">I will be faded out</div>`\n\nHope this helps,\nJan\n"

        "body": "Hi Eppel,\n\nthere actually is an example, right below the documentation of \"addTween\".\nThere it says:\n\u00b4\u00b4\u00b4\ncontroller.addTween('#fade', \n        TweenMax.from($('#fade'), .5, {css:{opacity:0}}));\n\u00b4\u00b4\u00b4\nSo in this case '#fade' is the target. A target is sort of a reference of where an animation should start.\nIf it's a number then the animation will be triggered at the respective offset from the top.\nIf it's a selector (like in this case) or a jQuery object (which is basically the same thing, but with $() wrapped around it) then this element will be used as a reference. So when the scroll position reaches the top offset of this element the animation will start.\n\nI hope this clears things up for you.\n\nregards,\nJan\n"

        "body": "Hi Aris,\n\non a first glance your code does look fine.\n\nHere are some notes that might help you:\nThe first parameter for addTween doesn't necessarily have to be the element that is animated. It is the reference that is used to know when (where) the animation should start.\n\nAs I built sites where this exact case does work (refreshing below animations) I am quite confident it's not a  problem with superscrollorama. See [here](http://public.orsi-and-jan.info/).\n\nSo my guess is that it may have something to do with your setup, specifically the loading algorithm. Maybe the elements are not available when superscrollorama is called or their position values are set afterwards.\nThe way I would approach this is by console.logging some values within the checkAnim method and see if everything is like it should be.\n\nIf you end up not finding a solution you may use this dirty workaround: do a `window.scrollTo(0, 0);` on page load.\nRemember this is sort of a developer-problem an end user would probably never do. (why would you scroll down a page, refresh and scroll back up).\n\nI do however understand the need to have it work \"clean\". So good luck with that.\nIf you figure out what the problem was, please let us know.\n\nregards,\nJan\n"

It was just a matter of what was faster for me to finish my project, finding a public facing server to host what I would hope could duplicate the problem I was experiencing, or finding another library and/or get approval from designers to make a change. Since the site is built in wordpress and is for one of our clients, well that just wouldn't be possible for me to get you access. Luckily, the designer compromised and we are going another route. Unfortunate because I like this script, but with a deadline a week away I can't convince my boss what I would 'like' to use if it meant missing it. If my last response seemed rude, I apologize. Impending deadlines typically make my responses very short.\n"

The only way to make sure is to do it by hand.\n\nI assume your problems don't really have anything to do with superscrollorama, but rather with some errors in the DOM or CSS, which chrome and firefox handle better than safari.\n\nI suggest you deactivate superscrollorama and try to get the positioning in safari right, before you reactivate it.\nSafari is definitely supported, both by superscrollorama and TweenMax.\n\nI hope this helps,\nregards,\nJan\n"

        "body": "Shit, I think i got it.\n\nMy first guess was actually correct. The element you are trying to tween is not available. Well one of them.\nIt has nothing to do with the noconflict mode. It was just difficult finding the problem, because for some reason all your sourcecode is without linewraps.\n\nI was just always checking for \".fly-it\", but the element that is missing is actually \".fade-it\".\n\nPlease make sure that this element exists. AND is not set to display: none.\nThe reason for this is that for elements that have this style it's impossible to calculate the offset position.\nSee here for details: http://api.jquery.com/offset\n\nActually there is a small fix for this in the latest version of superscrollorama to avoid an error when an element is set to display: none. So be sure to download the latest version. Of course the animation still wouldn't work but at least there'd be no error.\n\nI think we finally solved this one, right?\n\nregards,\nJan\n"

        "body": "Hi vossavant,\n\nI'm not a 100% sure I understand what you are trying to do, but I think you are looking for this:\n\n```\n// prepare animation\nvar pinAnimation = new TimelineLite()\n        .append( TweenMax.from( $( '#our-work h1' ), 3, { right : '-500px' } ) )\n        .append( TweenMax.to( $( '#our-work nav' ), 3, { left : '160px' } ) );\n\n// add each portfolio item\n$( '#portfolio-inner .item' ).each( function() {\n        pinAnimation.append(\n                TweenMax.from( $( this ), 1, { \n                    delay : Math.random() * .2,\n                    css : { opacity : 0, x: Math.random() * maxX - (maxX / 2), y: Math.random() * maxY - (maxY / 2) },\n                    ease    : Power3.easeInOut\n                } )\n        );\n} );\n\n// create pin\ncontroller.pin( $( '#our-work' ), 3000, {\n    anim : pinAnimation,\n    onPin: function() {\n        $( '#our-work' ).css( 'height', '100%' );\n    }, \n    onUnpin: function() {\n        $( '#our-work' ).css( 'height', '1000px' );\n    }\n} );\n```\n\nThis way though the elements will all be animated in sequence, but during the pin.\nIf you want to start them simultaneously put them into an array and add them together.\nLook at the \"delay\" option to tune your animation to your needs.\nAlso you should use \"add\" instead of \"append\", as it is deprecated.\n\nMore info see here: http://api.greensock.com/js/com/greensock/TimelineMax.html\n\nhope this helps, best regards,\nJan\n\nP.S.: The way I build animations for superscrollorama is just adding the TweenMax options, without adding them to superscrollorama. Only once I get the animation the way I want it I add it to superscrollorama.\n"

I can't really see anything wrong with it.\n\n2) I tried zooming in using chrome on the demo page (http://johnpolacek.github.io/superscrollorama/) and even on your example page. Both seem to work!\n\nregards,\nJan\n"

        "body": "Yup, its a browser issue- possibly related to how chrome interprets the scroll speed of your device, and also influenced by your hardware. \n\nI have a little asus laptop with a touch screen and when I scroll with it, it has a sort of velocity response that causes the page to scroll at a much faster rate than I can reproduce with the touchpad or keyboard. It also accrues a scroll 'queue' that retains every scroll event, if I scroll quickly. In Chrome, scrolling at a fast rate causes that glitch. Doesn't happen in other browsers.\n\nIts also possibly related to your hardware, as I also produced this glitch in chrome scrolling at a normal speed with superscrollorama but using a really graphic heavy page. Lots of big pngs and intricate SVG's all scrolling at different speeds caused general slowdown, and the more CPU-intense things got, the more this glitch occurred in Chrome.\n\nYou could reproduce it on an older computer easily, or on a nice one with a large files as the background images of  animating divs (scrolling a background slower than normal) and some CPU killing css like background-size:cover. \n"

So check out: the Greensock Scroll Plugin: http://api.greensock.com/js/com/greensock/plugins/ScrollToPlugin.html\n\nThen I would replace the default action of any or all anchors with scrolling to it instead of jumping to it.\nSomething like this (**untested**):\n\n```\n$(\"a[href^=#]\").each(function(e) {\n     e.preventDefault();\n     var offset = $(this).offset();\n     TweenLite.to(window, 2, {scrollTo:{y:offset.top}, ease:Power2.easeOut});\n});\n```\n\nHope this helps! :)\nhave fun,\nJan\n"

So 2000px below it's starting position.\nAs superscrollorama is very exact the pin should then start right after the last article pin ended.\nIf you want to start a little earlier or later, use the offset option.\n\nHope this helps,\nregards,\nJan\n"

I don't know where to add them. \n\nI tried to modify it like this:\n\n```\n        controller.addTween(\n            '#gun',\n            (new TimelineLite())\n                .add([\n                    TweenMax.fromTo($('#hammer'), 1, \n                        {css:{rotation: 0}, immediateRender:true}, \n                        {css:{rotation: -25}, ease:Quad.easeInOut}),\n                    TweenMax.fromTo($('#trigger'), 1, \n                        {css:{rotation: 0}, immediateRender:true}, \n                        {css:{rotation: 40}, ease:Quad.easeInOut})\n                    ]),\n                    500,\n                    200\n\n                .add(\n                    TweenMax.to($('#hammer'), 1, {css:{rotation: 0}}, \n                    ),\n                500, // scroll duration of tween\n                200 // offset?\n        ); \n```\n\nBut alas, that did nothing. Any other ideas? Thanks!\n"

This is because if it would the position of the pinned element would be reset to where it was before it was pinned.\nRight now I'm thinking about including an option switch in the method in the next update to let the user decide if he wants the spacers removed as well.\n\nTo avoid the creation of spacers altogether you might want to set \"pushFollowers\" to false.\nThen you'll have to set the distance between the pinned elements manually (create a spacer element yourself)\n\nHope this helps,\nregards,\nJan\n"

        "body": "Hi Jan,\n\nThanks for the quick response. Setting \"pushFollowers\" to false creates more problems than it solves. I'm not sure if this is intended, but setting that parameter to \"false\" does not prevent creation of spacer elements, though their height seems to be set to the viewport height vs. scroll duration. I updated the staging site link from above with the parameter set to false so you can see what is happening.\n\nIt's likely I just don't know how to use that parameter. If I am pinning each <article> element, should each <article> element have a particular height (e.g., the viewport height), or should I be adding my own spacers after each <article>?\n\nSwitching between stories as described above still creates multiple spacers, though I can't tell if this is what is causing my animations to break down.\n\nP.S. There is also a strange \"jump\" when you scroll to the bottom of the page, and I have no idea how to prevent that. It seems to happen sometimes, usually when you are at the bottom of the page. I don't know how to resolve it but suspect it is related to issue #29 (you proposed the same solution of using \"pushFollowers=false\" there).\n\nThanks.\n"

The reason is that the spacer is used to \"remember\" where the pinned element was originally positioned. As the position might change when resizing the site (e.g. with div 100% wrappers) this is necessary.\nBut when using pushFollowers:false the spacer is not resized.\n\nTo answer your second question: Yes you should have a spacer after each element with the height of your pin duration.\n\nlet's get the remove work properly first and then we can worry about the jump :).\n\nregards,\nJ\n"

        "body": "Hi Jan,\n\nThanks for the clarification :)\n\nI'm getting somewhere now. There is one small issue remaining: if you check the staging link I sent you (updated) you'll see I've added spacers after each <article> with a class of \"myspacer\". These are in addition to Scrollorama's spacers. For some reason, the scroll duration between the first and second <article> is larger than the scroll duration between any of the other spacers. It seems that the scroll duration between the first and second <article> is the sum of your spacer and my spacer, but just my spacer on subsequent articles.\n\nAny idea why that is?\n\nAlso, you'll see the \"jump\" still on the staging link. Let me know when we can address that. Thank you VERY MUCH for your awesome help.\n\nRyan\n"

This is something we have planned for future versions.\nBut here's something that might serve you as a workaround:\n\nCreate a container for the element that you want to animate. Set it's height to 100% of the window's height.\nThen position your element inside of the container using css \"bottom\" positioning.\nThen add the tween in reference to the container, so that when the container hits the top of the page your element will be at the bottom. \nHope this is clear enough.\n\nregards,\nJan\n"

If you look now, you'll see that the second <article> takes longer to appear than the ones after it. The \"jitter\" at the bottom of the page (that prevents you from scrolling to the very bottom) is no longer a problem, but I don't know why it went away. I'm guessing it has to do with the height of pinned elements, but could never determine that for certain.\n\n**Update:** I discovered the cause of the extra space between the first and second <article> elements. It's because I am not pinning the first element, and animating it in separately. I've been unable to determine how to even out the spacing.\n"

It does work on this machine though (OSX 10.6.8, Safari 5.1.9).\n\nAnyways: I think this is a TweenMax Issue.\nTo verify you could disable all superscrollorama animations and try then.\nIf the error persists (which I'm guessing) I'm afraid you'll have try your luck in the [greensock forums](http://forums.greensock.com/forum/11-animation-tweening-js/).\n\nregards,\nJ\n"

For example if you want to pin it for 5000px put in an empty div after the pinned element with the height of 5000px.\n\nLet me know if this helps in this case,\nregards,\nJ\n"

Maybe a little demo-video of the issue would help me understand?\n\nAnother way might be this:\nHave you read that I started working on [ScrollMagic](https://github.com/janpaepke/ScrollMagic)?\nIt's Superscrolloramas Child so to say. :) It is still in pre-release and in a very early state but maybe you can try it out for that very last bit. See how it goes...\nI build it with all the nagging little issues in mind that always popped up.\n\nImportant: I have not tested yet how it behaves with pin elements and the triggers being the same. So please make sure they are seperate. Maybe set up a test-case to find out how it works. Here are some notes: https://github.com/johnpolacek/superscrollorama/issues/94\nLet me know how it goes.\n\nregards,\nJ\n"

        "body": "Hi Jan,\n\nThanks for the reply. I would love to try ScrollMagic, but the site just went live so refactoring the code at this point is not an option.\n\nI made a short screen capture video for you. It's in .wmv format, so let me know if you need another format.\n\nThe first part of the clip shows me successfully scrolling to the bottom. Notice there is no jumping.\n\nThen, I resize the browser window, and scroll down tot he bottom again. Notice how the contact form jumps down again and again. This is because the form's position is switching between \"fixed\" and \"relative\".\n\nAt the end of the clip, I maximize the browser and scroll down again to show that, when the window is large enough to contain the pinned area, the problem disappears.\n\nHopefully this helps illustrate the problem. Let me know if you need any more details!\n\nThis does not appear to be a problem in Firefox, but is an issue in Chrome and IE.\n\nHere is a link to the video:\n\nhttp://factionmedia.com/scroll-capture.wmv\n"

        "body": "Ok I'm assuming this is a phenomenon that is caused by superscrolloramas handling of pin spacers.\nThe current behaviour is that they expand only once the pin has started (or stay expanded afterwards, respectively).\nI'm guessing this is what messes up the anchors: The positions are actually correct, but by the time you get there they have changed.\n\nSo what you should try is what I recommended a lot of times now:\nSet pushFollowers to false and add your own spacers for the duration of the pin.\nSo for example you have a div and want to pin it for 300px, then add a spacer div after it and make it 300px in height.\n\nThis is actually one of the most problematic things about superscrollorama and I entirely reworked it in ScrollMagic.\nThere spacers wrap around pin elements, and expand right from the start.\nEven though this already works it is still in pre-release phase so probably not interesting for a working project.\nBut if you want to give it a whirl, feel free to do so:\nSee Issue https://github.com/johnpolacek/superscrollorama/issues/94\n\nbest regards,\nJan\n"

        "body": "Yea I was actually looking at source code of it and debated on using it.  The pinning and the spacers are actually fine.  I was hard setting the animations to be completed and jumping past them fine but they would never reverse or complete again.  Really the only reason why I didn't just move it to ScrollMagic is the lack of documentation on it right now.  I don't mind beta projects.  \n\nThe biggest issue right now is that I am pinning a 400 pixel tall item but I want it to animate over lets say 600 pixels in the TimelineLite so I would have 10 elements that animate over 60 pixels each.  That difference between the two is what is causing me the most issues because my own manual spacers didn't seem to compensate for that.  I kinda need a way to trigger all the TimelineLite animations in the pins to not animate.\n\nI tried unpinning all the animations but that didn't seem to have the desired effect.\n"

So you need to call updatePin on every window resize and set the new offset.\n\nThis is an Issue that I resolved in [ScrollMagic](https://github.com/janpaepke/ScrollMagic), the future version of Superscrollorama.\n\nregards,\nJ\n"

So if you do a reload and jump past 800 and you scroll back upwards it means to superscrollorama animate from 0 to what it was before. What it was before was 0 though, because you set that in the css. It's different when you scroll down normally, as then the \"before-value\" is 1, because you hit the first trigger.\n\nHere's how you get what you want:\ninstead of TweenMax.to use TweenMax.fromTo.\nThere you can set a start and an end value to a tween.\nThis way you can make sure it is always tweened the way you want.\n\nregards,\nJ\n"

        "body": "Hi James,\n\nagain I'm really having trouble following your train of thought.\nPlease try to put yourself into the position of someone that is not as deep inside the code as you surely must be by now. If possible simplify the problem or make a demo page with one single element and one single occurrence of your suspected error.\nThis makes it much easier for you and for us to track down the problem.\n\nThat beeing said I have one suspicion as to what's causing your problems.\nYou use your pinned elements both as triggers as well as subjects of your animations.\nThis is generally okay if all you do is change colors or opacity. But when you start changing the position or size that's where problems (might) start.\nIf your pin element is 800px of height before the pin and only 200px as is the case with your #platform-intro this obviously influences the position of following elements.\nThat's what might be causing problems with the trigger positions, when scrolling back up.\n\nHere's how I would approach it:\nTry to have the triggers seperate from your tween-targets.\nOr even better: have wrappers around the sections you want to pin and only use them to pin. Any changes in size or position do on the Section itself INSIDE the pinned element.\n\nHope this helps,\nbest regards,\nJan\n"

        "body": "Sorry Jan for being so obscure,  I have tried having separate containers for triggering actions for the pins.  I also tried removing the resizing actions to see if that would resolve the issue, it did not.  Whatever was happening is not because of either of these separate thoughts, though I don't think I tried removing them both at the same time.  I will try to make a demo page as an example this week if I have time.  Basically what I think is happening is that some of the on reverse logic while in the middle of a pin is being wonky.\n\nFrom what I was able to diagnose by adding some log code is that the when initiating the reverse in the middle of a pin for some reason the state seems to stay pinned.  I will try to narrow down the cause more.\n\nJames\n"

This only happens when the starting point of the pin is a scroll position 0,  IE when the pin starts at the top of the page.  This is because of a logic issue on line 187  (currScrollPoint < startPoint && pinObj.state === 'AFTER')  on line 187  \n\nIf the start point is 0 then this logic can't be true.  That way it won't stall on the logic sometimes?  This happens because of scrolling has it been set to a strange state.\n\nI have tested this and this has resolved my issue but I just don't want to break anything else and you are more familiar with the code then I am.  \n\nI submitted a change request on the old superscroll to have that included.\n"

        "body": "Hi, welcome and thank you. :)\n\nSo here are my thoughts on performance:\nWhat costs most in superscrollorama is calling the checkScrollAnim.\nTo go easy on the client it is usually only called on tick of the TweenMax class.\nSo if you call triggerCheckAnim regularly somewhere (i.E. on resize) make sure it has the parameter false (or nothing, as false is default) passed to it.\nAll other performance issues are caused by other objects, such as TweenMax, displaying your animations.\nWhat might make your retina macbook suffer might be extra high res images that you animate or something. Just guesswork here :).\nMy 2008 Macbook Pro performce the site... well acceptable. =)\n\nAs to your question about the position quirks when reloading you have to be aware that no user will usually do that. It's only something you come accross during development.\nThat being said I think it can probably be resolved by setting pushFollowers to false and setting your spacers manually, as described multiple times, for example here https://github.com/johnpolacek/superscrollorama/issues/93\n\nI hope this helps, great site by the way!\n\nbest regards,\nJan\n"

        "body": "Ah, I guess, I know whats happening.\nWhen you scroll too fast the first tween is still running when the second is supposed to start.\nSo what you'll need to do is tell TweenMax to overwrite other tweens if there are still running some.\nThis can be achieved using the overwrite option of TweenMax.\nThe Tweenmax Documentation says:\n\n```\n\"auto\" (2) - when the tween renders for the first time, it will analyze tweens of the same target that are currently active/running and only overwrite individual tweening properties that overlap/conflict. Tweens that haven't begun yet are ignored. For example, if another active tween is found that is tweening 3 properties, only 1 of which it shares in common with the new tween, the other 2 properties will be left alone. Only the conflicting property gets overwritten/killed. This is the default mode and typically the most intuitive for developers.\n```\n\nSo what I think you should do is define your Tweens like this:\n\n``` js\n        var tweenIn1 = TweenMax.fromTo($('#textleft'), .3, {\n            css: {                    \n                top: '22%'\n            },\n            overwrite: \"auto\",\n            ease: Back.easeOut\n        });\n```\n\nas an extra bonus tip note, that with the current version of TweenMax you dont have to use css options as an object anymore...\n\n``` js\n        var tweenIn1 = TweenMax.fromTo($('#textleft'), .3, {\n            top: '22%',\n            overwrite: \"auto\",\n            ease: Back.easeOut\n        });\n```\n"

We have cases that you can reach fro the page with a \"Back button\". But we have solved that issue by making the page scroll back to the cases :).\n\nGood to hear it's running well on your Macbook, we can't excpect this site to run very good on all systems of course. We understand that, it just happens to be that I have one colleague wit a retina macbook. But it's just the way it is and I think you are right about the reason for the performance loss.\n\nBest regards, \n\nDion.\n"

        "body": "I have had this issue happen a number of times with me as well,  I took a 3 step approach to this,  wrap all animations in a timeline, it is really easy to wrap a timeline inside of a timeline to make sure everything happens in a sequence, manually clean up bad animation with simple jquery function, ensure everything happens in the tweens by not having triggering elements also have animation happen to them.  \n\nI used timelineLite to wrap all tweens to make sure they finish and are handled.  This seemed to help with my issues,  even if I only have one animation for the tween I still put it in there.  This also gives me onStart, onUpdate and onComplete ability to trigger functions to clean up some mess on animation.  When I scrolled fast for example I would have multiple animations stuck in an active state.  Most of my animations are progressively triggering display:block on display:none elements so I made a quick script to hide the siblings of the element.  See code below,  on every update the function runs to make sure no stuck frames in the animation.  You could run this on just onComplete if you wanted, onUpdateScope lets me pass the jquery object I want to make sure $(this) is referencing so the function is really simple.  \n\n```\nvar timeLine1 = new TimelineLite({align: \"sequence\"})\n    .append([TweenMax.to($('#display-platform-list .frame-1'), 2, {css:{display:'block'},onUpdate:removeSiblings,onUpdateScope:$('#display-platform-list .frame-1')})])\n    .append([TweenMax.to($('#display-platform-list .frame-2'), 2, {css:{display:'block'},onUpdate:removeSiblings,onUpdateScope:$('#display-platform-list .frame-2')})])\n    .append([TweenMax.to($('#display-platform-list .frame-3'), 2, {css:{display:'block'},onUpdate:removeSiblings,onUpdateScope:$('#display-platform-list .frame-3')})])\n    .append([TweenMax.to($('#display-platform-list .frame-4'), 2, {css:{display:'block'},onUpdate:removeSiblings,onUpdateScope:$('#display-platform-list .frame-4')})])\n    .append([TweenMax.to($('#display-platform-list .frame-5'), 2, {css:{display:'block'},onUpdate:removeSiblings,onUpdateScope:$('#display-platform-list .frame-5')})])\n    .append([TweenMax.fromTo( $('#platform .callout'), 1, {css:{opacity: 1}}, {css:{opacity: 0}})]);\n\nfunction removeSiblings(){\n    $(this).siblings().hide();\n}\n```\n\nI am not sure how much this specific example applies to your situation but hope it gives you some ideas.  I would also advise you not to mess with top and left when doing animations because this will confuse placements, try to use margins where possible.\n"

        "body": "Hi Stefano,\n\nthank you for setting up the demo. This helps a lot.\n\nI think I might understand now. To my mind superscrollorama does exactly what is supposed to, namely positioning the box exactly where it's supposed to be at the respective point in time.\nSo if you go fast you won't see it going from left to right, but go to bottom instead (as that's the position it's supposed to be at at that point).\nSince you have playoutAnimations set to true sometimes this may cause it to animate differently than expected. (as the start position is not the end of the previous animation, but the position before that.)\nBut even with playoutAnimations false the position can sometimes be wrong for the exact same reason.\n\nWhat TweenMax.to does is always animate from the previous state.\n\nTo give you an example:\nani 1 animates margin left to 750. previously it was 0 so it will animate to 750.\nani 2 animates back to 0.\nani 3 animates top to 750.\n\nSo obviously you expect the box to be at left 0, top 750 when finishing ani 3.\nBut if you scroll fast enough to skip ani 2 completly the position will in fact be left 750, top 750.\nSo try this code instead:\n\n``` javascript\n$(function ($) {\n    controller = $.superscrollorama();\n\n    controller.addTween(100, TweenMax.to($('#moving'), .3, {\n                marginLeft: 750,\n                marginTop: 0\n            }), 300);\n    controller.addTween(500, TweenMax.to($('#moving'), .3, {\n                marginLeft: 0,\n                marginTop: 0\n            }), 300);\n    controller.addTween(900, TweenMax.to($('#moving'), .3, {\n                marginLeft: 0,\n                marginTop: 750\n            }), 300);\n    controller.addTween(1300, TweenMax.to($('#moving'), .3, {\n                marginLeft: 0,\n                marginTop: 0\n            }), 300);\n\n    controller.addTween(2000, TweenMax.to($('#moving'), .3, {\n                marginLeft: 750,\n                marginTop: 0\n            }), 300);\n    controller.addTween(2500, TweenMax.to($('#moving'), .3, {\n                marginLeft: 0,\n                marginTop: 0\n            }), 300);\n    controller.addTween(2900, TweenMax.to($('#moving'), .3, {\n                marginLeft: 0,\n                marginTop: 750\n            }), 300);\n    controller.addTween(3300, TweenMax.to($('#moving'), .3, {\n                marginLeft: 0,\n                marginTop: 0\n            }), 300);\n});\n\n\n\nfunction log(msg) {\n    if (console != \"undefined\") console.log(msg);\n    else alert(msg);\n}\n```\n\nBest regards,\nJ\n"

        "body": "Hi!\n\nActually you were correct to go to the TweenMax Forums, as this really isn't a superscrollorama issue.\nBut as I personally have a thing against newbie haters I'll try to help you.\n\nFirstly I would strongly recommend setting pushFollowers to false, so you'll have the correct positions of all pinned elements right from the start.\nBare in mind that his might require you to set your own spacers.\nFor detailed descriptions see issue https://github.com/johnpolacek/superscrollorama/issues/93 .\n\nSecondly I would add an anchor element at the top position of each pin element. This should be the point where you want to scroll when clicking the \"next\" link.\nTry out this setup by using anchors `<a name=\"myanchor\"></a>` and then have Buttons like `<a href=\"#myanchor\">next</a>`.\nWhen you click the link the page should now jump to the correct position.\nNow you don't want it to jump, but scroll instead, right?\n\nSo here's how you do it:\n\n``` javascript\n$(document).ready(function() {\n    // page internal links\n    $('a[href^=\"#\"]').click(function (e) {\n        var anchor = $(this).attr(\"href\").substr(1);\n        var $target = $('a[name=\"' + anchor + '\"]').first();\n        if ($target.length > 0) {\n            e.preventDefault();\n            var scrollYPos = $target.offset().top;\n            TweenLite.to(window, .7, {scrollTo:{y:scrollYPos, x:0}, ease:Power2.easeOut});\n        }\n    });\n});\n```\n\nBear in mind, that the ScrollTo plugin is not loaded by default.\nYou will have to include the javascript file. You can do it right after you include the main TweenMax file.\n\nPlease try not only to copy and paste the code (I have not tested it and it may not work).\nTry to understand what I did and redo it line by line.\nThis way you'll learn.\n\nregards,\nJ\n"

When you try it you will see it still gets stuck somewhere in the middle when you scroll very fast the first time.\nWhen I scroll slowly once then it's fine, also when I scroll fast afterwards. It kind of looks like the tweens don't get registered when I scroll fast in the beginning.\n\nAny other ideas? \n\nThank you!\n"

I will definitely use your demo to see how ScollMagic behaves with it, so please leave it online.\nAs for fixing your issue I would recommend trying to leave nothing to coincidence.\nTry this bulky but quite surely working code:\n\n``` javascript\n$(function ($) {\n    controller = $.superscrollorama();\n\n    controller.addTween(100, TweenMax.fromTo($('#moving'), .3, {\n                marginLeft: 0,\n                marginTop: 0\n            },\n            {\n                marginLeft: 750,\n                marginTop: 0\n            }), 300);\n    controller.addTween(500, TweenMax.to($('#moving'), .3, {\n                marginLeft: 750,\n                marginTop: 0\n            },\n            {\n                marginLeft: 0,\n                marginTop: 0\n            }), 300);\n    controller.addTween(900, TweenMax.to($('#moving'), .3, {\n                marginLeft: 0,\n                marginTop: 0\n            },\n            {\n                marginLeft: 0,\n                marginTop: 750\n            }), 300);\n    controller.addTween(1300, TweenMax.to($('#moving'), .3, {\n                marginLeft: 0,\n                marginTop: 750\n            },\n            {\n                marginLeft: 0,\n                marginTop: 0\n            }), 300);\n    controller.addTween(2000, TweenMax.to($('#moving'), .3, {\n                marginLeft: 0,\n                marginTop: 0,\n            },\n            {\n                marginLeft: 750,\n                marginTop: 0\n            }), 300);\n    controller.addTween(2500, TweenMax.to($('#moving'), .3, {\n                marginLeft: 750,\n                marginTop: 0,\n            },\n            {\n                marginLeft: 0,\n                marginTop: 0\n            }), 300);\n    controller.addTween(2900, TweenMax.to($('#moving'), .3, {\n                marginLeft: 0,\n                marginTop: 0\n            },\n            {\n                marginLeft: 0,\n                marginTop: 750\n            }), 300);\n    controller.addTween(3300, TweenMax.to($('#moving'), .3, {\n                marginLeft: 0,\n                marginTop: 750,\n            },\n            {\n                marginLeft: 0,\n                marginTop: 0\n            }), 300);\n});\n\n\n\nfunction log(msg) {\n    if (console != \"undefined\") console.log(msg);\n    else alert(msg);\n}\n```\n"

Please try to simplify your problem and I will be able to help you a lot better. Also trying to simplify it will help you better understand the code and you might even solve the problem yourself.\n\nSo I suggest you set up a demo page only featuring one svg and one line drawing and there you try to have it react to the scroll position. And then take it from there.\nIf you run into problems with that demo let me know and I will take a look.\n\nregards,\nJ\n"

        "body": "Hi James,\n\nthank you for your demo.\nActually this has nothing to do with superscrollorama, as it works exactly as intended.\nWhen scrolling before your set trigger point it reverts to the unpinned state.\n(fyi your trigger point in your case is the top position of #slides, which equals to 0).\nSo what you can do is either add a negative offset of like 1000 (remember to add it to the duration) to make sure that  it will also be pinned at negative scroll values or (and this is by far the better solution) fix the state of your #slides container in the unpinned position.\n\nI am quite sure if you disable all pinning scripts you will se that your #slides container disappears. Why?\nActually it doesn't disappear, its height becomes 0. Why, you ask again and why does it collapse when I scroll upwards?\nWell it collapses because as I said earlier it sets the div into the state that it was \"pre-pin\" and there's your problem.\n\nNow I asked the right questions.\nDo you want a solution or figure it out yourself? :)\n\nGive it a shot or check here for the solution: http://pastebin.com/CkZmB0AY\n\nbest regards,\nJ\n"

The scroll was so long that the duration was over and so your container got unpinned.\nWhat you saw was the result of the misplaced items in the unpinned state.\nThat is why I suggested making the duration longer to ensure it was kept pinned.\n\nbest regards,\nJ\n"

There are several modes to choose from, and TweenMax automatically calls OverwriteManager.init() if you haven\u2019t already manually dones so, which means that by default AUTO mode is used (please see http://www.greensock.com/overwritemanager/ for details and a full explanation of the various modes):\nNONE (0) (or false)\nALL_IMMEDIATE (1) (or true)\nAUTO (2) \u2013 this is the default mode for TweenMax.\nCONCURRENT (3)\nALL_ONSTART (4)\nPREEXISTING (5)\nExample: TweenMax.to(mc, 1, {x:100, overwrite:5});\n\nBy default you are on auto you are having some overwriting issues,  you really have two ways around this.  Wrap everything in a timelinelite and force it to go through a sequence or be better about managing your tweens overwriting.  \n"

I really had a hard time reading your code I have re factored it.\n\n@janpaepke  as you can clearly see if you comment out adding the tweens and the animation the image is already there.  I am not a svg pro but I would either have the animation change the style of the color of the lines from like white to orange to get the desired effect or some other styling method.  This is clearly a animation issue to me and not a scrolling issue.  \n\n@sleepydada as @janpaepke has told me on some of my own projects get your animation to work correctly first then add it to your scrolling logic. It is sound advice.\n\n```\n<!doctype html>\n<html lang=\"en-US\">\n<head>\n\n\n<title> Demo |  Goindoor</title>\n<script type='text/javascript' src='http://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.9.1/jquery.min.js?ver=3.7.1'></script>\n<script type='text/javascript' src='http://www.chartjs.org/docs/Chart.js?ver=3.7.1'></script>\n<script type='text/javascript' src='http://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/gsap/latest/TweenMax.min.js?ver=3.7.1'></script>\n<script type='text/javascript' src='http://www.goindoor.com/wp-content/themes/salient/js/jquery.superscrollorama.js?ver=3.7.1'></script>\n<script type='text/javascript' src='http://www.goindoor.com/wp-content/themes/salient/js/goindoor.js?ver=3.7.1'></script>\n\n</head>\n\n\n<body>\n<div id=\"padding\" style=\"padding-top: 300px;\"></div>\n<div id=\"hospital_drawing\">\n    <svg xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\" version=\"1.1\"  height=\"500\" width=\"960\">\n      <path id=\"lineAB\" d=\"M 706 10 l 89 57\"  stroke-width=\"3\" fill=\"none\" />\n      <path id=\"lineBC\" d=\" M 795 67 l 0 126\"  stroke-width=\"3\" fill=\"none\" />\n      <path id=\"lineCD\" d=\"M 795 192 l 114 73\"  stroke-width=\"3\" fill=\"none\" />\n      <path id=\"lineDE\" d=\"M 909 265 l -625 0\"  stroke-width=\"3\" fill=\"none\" />\n      <path id=\"lineEF\" d=\" M 284 265 l 0 70\" stroke-width=\"3\" fill=\"none\" />\n      <path id=\"lineFG\" d=\"M 284 335 l 92 53\"  stroke-width=\"3\" fill=\"none\" />\n    </svg>\n</div>\n\n\n<script>\n\njQuery(document).ready(function(e) {\n\n    var controller = jQuery.superscrollorama({});\n    var timeLine1 = new TimelineLite({})\n\n    var orig1 = document.querySelector('#lineAB');\n    var obj1 = {length:0,pathLength:orig1.getTotalLength()};\n    orig1.style.stroke = '#f60';\n\n    var orig2 = document.querySelector('#lineBC');\n    var obj2 = {length:0,pathLength:orig2.getTotalLength()};\n    orig2.style.stroke = '#f60';\n\n    var orig3 = document.querySelector('#lineCD');\n    var obj3 = {length:0,pathLength:orig3.getTotalLength()};\n    orig3.style.stroke = '#f60';\n\n    var orig4 = document.querySelector('#lineDE');\n    var obj4 = {length:0,pathLength:orig4.getTotalLength()};\n    orig4.style.stroke = '#f60';\n\n    var orig5 = document.querySelector('#lineEF');\n    var obj5 = {length:0,pathLength:orig5.getTotalLength()};\n    orig5.style.stroke = '#f60';\n\n    var orig6 = document.querySelector('#lineFG');\n    var obj6 = {length:0,pathLength:orig6.getTotalLength()};\n    orig6.style.stroke = '#f60';\n\n    function drawLine1() {orig1.style.strokeDasharray = [obj1.length,obj1.pathLength].join(' ');}\n    function drawLine2() {orig2.style.strokeDasharray = [obj2.length,obj2.pathLength].join(' ');}\n    function drawLine3() {orig3.style.strokeDasharray = [obj3.length,obj3.pathLength].join(' ');}\n    function drawLine4() {orig4.style.strokeDasharray = [obj4.length,obj4.pathLength].join(' ');}\n    function drawLine5() {orig5.style.strokeDasharray = [obj5.length,obj5.pathLength].join(' ');}\n    function drawLine6() {orig6.style.strokeDasharray = [obj6.length,obj6.pathLength].join(' ');}\n\n     // You can comment out this code for the tweens and timeline to prevent the animation\n\n//  var tween1 = TweenMax.to(obj1, .5, {length:obj1.pathLength, onUpdate:drawLine1, delay:4,ease:Linear.easeNone,immediateRender: false});\n//  var tween2 = TweenMax.to(obj2, .5, {length:obj2.pathLength, onUpdate:drawLine2, delay:6,ease:Linear.easeNone,immediateRender: false});\n//  var tween3 = TweenMax.to(obj3, .5, {length:obj3.pathLength, onUpdate:drawLine3, delay:8,ease:Linear.easeNonem,immediateRender: false});\n//  var tween4 = TweenMax.to(obj4, .5, {length:obj4.pathLength, onUpdate:drawLine4, delay:10,ease:Linear.easeNone,immediateRender: false});\n//  var tween5 = TweenMax.to(obj5, .5, {length:obj5.pathLength, onUpdate:drawLine5, delay:12,ease:Linear.easeNone,immediateRender: false});\n//  var tween6 = TweenMax.to(obj6, .5, {length:obj6.pathLength, onUpdate:drawLine6, delay:14,ease:Linear.easeNone,immediateRender: false});\n\n//  tl.timeLine1([tween1, tween2, tween3, tween4, tween5, tween6], \"+=2\", \"sequence\", 0.5);\n\n});\n</script>\n\n</body>\n</html>\n```\n"

You pass in a parameter for the next tween and if you follow a naming schema you can do it dynamically.  \n\nI think you are running into the fundamental issue of how superscrollorama interacts with the greensock animation is that it updates the progress of the timeline or tween based on the scroll amount vs number of pixels you have for the scroll.  \n\nAs in the previous issue I gave you an example where onUpdate i was running a js function to clean up the animation,  it is going to happen where the progress gets messed up.  I really only see the two ways of getting around this if you can't get your animation to work right within a timeline.  \n\nHowever I still feel that you can accomplish this in a normal timeline if you set the overwrite property to none.  If that still doesn't work then you will have to manually clean up your tweens.\n1.  Dynamically add the next tween on on complete and update,  which this is going to be rather cumbersome.\n2.  Have a function that keeps track of where you are in progress of the animation.  If you have 10 tweens and jumped to tween 3,  make sure you onStart check where you are in your progress and force the animation to do what you want. \n"

On the final pane/tween of Guest1, I want to Ajax in content for Guest3. (using onComplete function).  This is so if I have 10 guests, I don't load all of them at once.\n\nIn my GS timeline, I have rules for Guest3, but when I AJAX the panes and innerHTML them to the containing DIV of Guest 3,  the ANIM rules in the timeline ignore the AJAXed html elements.  I'm assuming this is because the timeline is built off of the DOM structure on domReady.  I thought that triggerCheckAnim() would update and catch these new items, but I guess I misunderstand it's use.\n\nIs there a way to tell the system to update and catch the new AJAXed elements?\n"

        "body": "Hello and sorry for the late reply.\nI was quite busy :-/.\n\nFirst you have to see the Timeline and Superscrollorama to be very seperate things.\nSuperscrollorama merely acts as a scrubber for the animations you create with TweenMax.\n\nThe reason your timeline doesn't work on newly added element is that no Tween has been defined for them. Maybe there is a way to add Animations for certain selectors and make them constant (as to react on dom changes) but I doubt it and you will have to ask in the TweenMax forums.\n\nBut as for your questions:\n\n1.) no there is not. In my opinion you'll have to build a new Tween each time you add new content.\n2.) just add the tween as you normally would and then create an animation using \"AddTween\" that is in general independent of the pin but starts at the same position. Another way would be to remove the pin and add it again with a fully rebuilt Timeline.\n3.) that is another possibility. I don't know what exactly your animations are but you might be able to add invisible containers for Guest 3 at the beginning and only add their content after the AJAX request and then switch it to visible.\n\nhope this helps,\nregards\nJ\n"

        "body": "Hi and thanks for the feedback. \n\nThe js file did help a bit. The main difference is I'm trying to make the nav anchors work inside a section that's already pinned, not the entire page. So it seems like I need to use nested pins. I'm having problems getting a demo to work in Codepen but I'll keep trying. Instead I'll paste the code I'm working with.\n\nBasically, I can get the '.pin-block' section to pin and animate when scrolling, but can't get the anchor links to perform the same animation.\n\nSo I've tried calling the each panel animation from inside of the onPin event of the '.pin-block'  section. But this makes the first animation repeat without scrolling to the second.\n\nSorry if this is confusing. Hope the code helps:\n\n``` HTML\n    <section class=\"pin-block\">\n        <div class=\"panels\">\n            <ul class=\"panel-nav\">\n                <li class=\"panel-nav-1\"><a href=\"#panel1\">Complete Calendar</a></li>\n                <li class=\"panel-nav-2\"><a href=\"#panel2\">Easy Attachments</a></li>\n            </ul>\n            <div class=\"panelbed-content\">\n                <article id=\"panel-1\">\n                    <div class=\"inner\">\n                        <h1>Conquer Your Calendar</h1>\n                        <p>Switching between your email and calendar apps is now a thing of the past.

Why might that be?\n(btw. the same error exists with the other pins i've checked.)\n\nregards,\nJ\n"

So maybe you forgot the wrappers in your DOM or something.\nAnyway that's why the animation happens too early. It just stats at the scroll position of 0.\nYour definition of the duration is correct.\nThe offset should be a pixel offset in relation to your trigger position.\nSo if you want the animation to start before the trigger is visible, use a positive offset, if you want to delay the animation use a negative offset.\n\nI hope this helps.\n\nregards,\nJan\n"

Then when panel 2 is pinned the animation is to animate panel 3 down (which had a negativ position before).\nSince there's probably more content in panel 2 though I would recommend a setup like this:\n\n``` HTML\n<div id=\"wrap\">\n    <div id=\"panel1\" class=\"pin\"></div>\n    <div id=\"panelwrap\" class=\"pin\">\n        <div id=\"panel2\"></div>\n        <div id=\"panel3\" class=\"animate\"></div>\n    </div>\n</div>\n```\n\n(the classes are only to identify what to pin and what to animate)\nAlso make sure panel3 has position set to absolute so only panel 2 is affecting panelwrap's height.\n\nregards,\nJan\n"

        "body": "Hi roger,\n\nI think I understand.\nAn anchor link tries to scroll to where the respective element would touch the top of the screen.\nThe thing is, as long as they are inside a pinned div this could never happen.\nSo if you want to scroll at a certain point within the pin (NOT when the respective element touches the top) this would be changing the behaviour of anchor links.\nSo here's how I'd approach it:\nYou're pinning the block for a duration of 964px.\nso you need to figure out to which point in this duration the anchor link should scroll to and give this information to the respective link. Like this:\n\n``` HTML\n<a href=\"#panel1\" data-scrolloffset=\"300\">Complete Calendar</a>\n```\n\nThis would mean it should scroll to 300 px after the pin has started.\nThen catch the click to these links like this [untested code]:\n\n``` javascript\n$(\"a[data-scrolloffset]\").on(\"click\", function(e) {\n    e.preventDefault();\n    var\n        pinStartPos = $(\"section.pin-block\").prev(\"div.superscrollorama-pin-spacer\").offset().top,\n        targetPos = pinStartPos + $(this).attr(\"data-scrolloffset\");\n    $(window).scrollTop(targetPos);\n});\n```\n\nHope this helps!\n\nregards,\nJ\n"

So it is triggered as soon as the user starts scrolling and thus both the pin and the animations start.\nPosition you fighters wrapper correctly and it will work. :)\n\nAlso I noticed that you changed the superscrollorama base file setting the default for the scrolldirection (isVertical) to false.\nDon't do that. Instead when calling superscrollorama as you do in your animation.js on line 6 do it like this: `var controller = $.superscrollorama({isVertical: false});`.\n\nbest regards,\nJan\n"

        "body": "Hi Alan,\n\nthanks to your demo I fixed this issue for ScrollMagic.\nThe Reason for it is simple. When pinning an Element I need to convert its position to fixed. to do this I use the jQuery.css() method to get top and left position etc.\nThe curious thing though is that this always returns pixel values (even though you defined percentage values in your css).\n\nSo I found there are three ways to address this:\n1.) calculate the correct pixel values on resize (similar to what you did)\n2.) parse the Stylesheet for information about percentage positioning\n3.) Rely on inline styles (`<div style=\"left: 50%\">`) to achieve this effect.\n\nYou can read more on this issue and how to approach it [here](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/744319/get-css-rules-percentage-value-in-jquery) and [here](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/5230425/getting-percent-css-position-with-jquery).\n\nI ultimately decided against the first two options for the following reasons:\n1.) this would make the need for an additional parameter to the pin method. i.e. \"leftPosRelative\". Then I'd need to find out in relation to which element the position would need to be calculated, which may vary, according to DOM. All in all I found this too cluttering and unrelyable.\n2.) since there are virtually unlimited ways of applying CSS rules in a stylesheet there is absolutely no relyable way to make sure you have the correct definitions, if you set out to do it for all users...\n3.) this is the way I ultimately went with. There are no calculations needed and best flexibility. So if a user wants to position the pinned element centered he has to use inline styling to set left to 50%. If nothing is set $.css() will be used like before.\n\nI think think this is the best solution and I already put to work using your example.\nCheck this out:\nhttp://www.janpaepke.de/tmp/ScrollMagic_relative_positioning/positionfix_SCROLLMAGIC.html\n\nSo... one down! :)\n\nregards,\nJ\n"

        "body": "Hi!\nI don't think james meant for you to actually shrink the padding programmatically, like you did.\nJust set a fixed padding bottom and try to figure out the correct value so the flickering doesn't occur anymore.\nIn my experience the flickering is always for this reason: During Pin the element is fixed and doesn't account to the document's height or the position of the following elements.\nOnce unpinned it will though. So if there's a footer below it will be pushed further down, resulting in the page getting longer. This in turn makes your scroll position jump up a bit (because suddenly you are not at the end of the document anymore) and usually it jumps right back in to where the element is supposed to be pinned. Voil\u00e1, endless loop.\nThe solution is to make sure the Document has the correct length and it doesn't change.\nSet pushFollowers to false, define the size of the space before the footer (the duration of the pin) manually and make sure your pinned element or its container are positioned absolutely.\n\nregards,\nJan\n"

        "body": "Hi!\n\nActually it does work. When I inspect the element and check the bottom css parameter is animated.\nThe reason it doesn't move is that changing this parameter has no effect.\nAs a good rule of thumb:\n**Always try running your tweens before adding them to Superscrollorama and see if they work.**\nIf they don't the problem is in your Tween setup or markup, not in Superscrollorama.\n\nIn your case the problem is that changing a bottom position only has an effect if the element is positioned relatively or absolutely.\nI tried \"position: relative\" on \"#cartel\" and it works.\nIt flickers though, which has to do with the fact, that you use it both as a tween target and a trigger. So changing it's position results in display errors.\nWhen tweening the position of an element never use it as a trigger for that tween.\n\nHope this helps.\nregards,\nJan\n"

Maybe even just as a jsfiddle?\n\nregards,\nJan\n"

Because i have in diffrent pixels of scroll different animation on this object so i think when it fires so quickly it has some issue...\n"

When the function below is called for the first time, it does indeed disable the scene. However, from then on, calling this function does not seem to disable the scene. Am I doing something incorrectly here?\n\nfunction scrollToEl(sID) {\n    if (jQuery(sID).length) {\n        PhilosophyScene.enabled(false);\n        var offset = jQuery(sID).offset();\n        jQuery(\"html,body\").animate({\n            scrollTop: offset.top - 0,\n            scrollLeft: offset.left\n        }, 1000, 'easeOutQuart', function () { PhilosophyScene.enabled(true) });\n    }\n\n}\n\nThanks for your continued support.\n\nBen\n"
