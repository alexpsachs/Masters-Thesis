I haven't seen coffee files so far, \n- Testacular is now known as Karma.\n\nIt's definitely not a big deal but it have to be done for the Grunt task, isn't it?\n\nI will be glad to contribute to this project but just considering the small amount of time that I can spend on it.\n\nLet me know how I can help.\n"

        "author_association": "MEMBER",
        "body": "#### Using RegExp as a Mask\n\nThere are a couple more key components than just the placeholder that have to be processed from the mask.\n- `maskCaretMap` - An array of integers of positions within the input that the user is permitted to place the caret\u2014if the caret is placed in an invalid position, the caret gets moved to the closest valid position (moved backwards if clicking into the input or deleting characters, moved forward if typing or otherwise adding content to the input).\n- `maskPatterns` - An array of single-character-matching RegExp patterns. This is the backbone of the directive that does all the work. It's easiest to explain by referencing the line number of the forEach that unmasks the value: https://github.com/angular-ui/ui-utils/blob/master/modules/mask/mask.js#L144\n\nGiven a mask of `(999) 999-9999`, `maskCaretMap` looks like `[1, 2, 3, 6, 7, 8, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14]` and  `maskPatterns` looks like `[/\\d/, /\\d/, /\\d/, /\\d/, /\\d/, /\\d/, /\\d/, /\\d/, /\\d/, /\\d/]`.\n\nWhat `maskPatterns` really powers is stripping out characters that don't fit the mask. When a user types a character, the directive unmasks the input value to get the raw value and strip out any chars that don't match the mask, then remasks it to put back in the placeholder components. So if a user types a character that doesn't get matched by one of the RegExp patterns in `maskPatterns`, it gets stripped out before the user ever sees it appear in the input (except older IEs).\n\nNow, the biggest hurdle is allowing a user to specify a RegExp-based mask is preserving that as-you-type masking and stripping of invalid chars. You still need some way to check on a character-by-character basis if that char is valid or not. Parsing a RegExp pattern, I'm sure you'll agree, would be... unfeasible.\n\nI did a lot of thinking about this when I was in the process of rewriting the directive, and the closest I got to a solution was this: http://plnkr.co/edit/qKCgHmJqOg7iXczmup5i?p=preview Click on the `MM: __ DD: __ YYYY: ____` mask and try entering a month or day of 44 or 99 or something else that's invalid. The mask being passed to the plugin looks like `[\"MM: \", /[01]/, /\\d/, \" DD: \", /[0-3]/, /\\d/, \" YYYY: \", /[12]/, /[90]/, /\\d/, /\\d/]`, and you can see the code to support that style of mask (commented out) here: https://github.com/angular-ui/ui-utils/blob/master/modules/mask/mask.js#L174\n\nHowever, as I further considered this options, I began to ask myself, \"at what point does this begin to overreach it's intended purpose?\" Masking is not intended to be input validation\u2014there are plenty of ways to validate inputs, and shoehorning that into a masking directive feels wrong. There isn't a clear line between the two, but I think the real intent behind input masking is to assist the user in entering the correct information the first time without confusion, possibly before a proper validator tells them it's wrong. I think this is the right decision, but I think there will always be those who will want the masking directive to do comprehensive validation on top of basic masking.\n\n#### Optional Character Groups\n\nThis is interesting and I had never thought of that type of functionality. My first blush impression is that allowing that in the middle of a mask would result is some strange and undesirable UX behavior. I can see it being more appropriate for the end of a mask, such as for a phone extension. But, the big question is, how do you communicate to a user that one portion of the mask is optional and the other is not? In the case of phone extensions, I think you'd be better served by breaking it into two input fields, one for the phone, the other for the extension.\n\nAre there any solid use cases for optional character groups out there? I'd like to think about this more, but I can't think of when using two inputs or swapping the mask wouldn't be a better solution.\n\n#### Switch Case Functionality\n\nThis would be better accomplished in the controller. Set the mask in the scope, put a `$watch` on the `NgModelController.$viewValue` property of the input and change the mask based on the `$viewValue`.\n\n#### Func-Based Mask\n\nI don't understand, can you clarify this please?\n"

It would regenerate the mask as the user types. since the user can't \"skip\" the carret, would make sense to make it _realtime_ as it types. For example, the phone example I used, S\u00e3o Paulo area code is 11, so as soon the user fills the mask (11) the mask changes to (11) 99999-9999, if its (19), it changes back to (19) 9999-9999\n\nand btw, that regexp mask using an array of regex is really clever! that solves a lot of problems with complicated patterns and still make the mask functional.\n"

        "body": "Re-evaluating as if the $viewValue had changed sounds like a good idea.  However $setViewValue has the side effects of changing the dirty/pristine state as well as triggering ngChange would should only be fired off of changes to the view/input made by the user which would not be the case off of the watch.  Also all parsers should be reevaluated as they may depend on the others.\n\n``` javascript\nfunction evaluateParsers(){\n  var value=ctrl.$viewValue;\n  angular.forEach(ctrl.$parsers, function(fn) {\n    value = fn(value);\n  });\n\n  if (ctrl.$modelValue !== value) {\n    ctrl.$modelValue = value;\n    ngModelSet(scope,value);\n  }\n}\n```\n\nhttp://plnkr.co/edit/tvYLI35yuEnWio3mfHjj?p=preview\n\nThoughts?\n\nHonestly though this validation in general can act pretty odd.  if I have two separate validators such as > 5 and < 10.  if I put in 11, > 5 is valid but < 10 is not and model is left as undefined.  But if I put in 4 then > 5 is invalid but < 10 is also invalid because undefined from the previous validator / parser is used as its input.  \n"

        "body": "the biggest use is for dates: 19/39/2999 or 39/19/2999 (that I usually use)\n\nAnyone can easily remove the mask that they want using `delete maskConfig.maskDefinitions['1']` for example. I've even added more tests, including tests that were missing to the optional `?` char. But of course, it can come without any of those extra masks, and I'll just add mines. \n\nOne thing that I didn't include in this commit is the ability to set the model to the $viewValue. I always want my data to be formatted, let the server deal with the 'unformatting', I shall make another push if this get merged depending on how it goes.\n\nThat's why I also wanted a \"fixed\" non mask character modifier that could signal to the directive to skip that number of mask. It could be quoted, like `+'1' (999) 999-9999`, that would make the 1 'fixed' and make the directive ignore/skip it. there's also another library for jQuery called meiomask, it has some default mask values, like credit cards, phone numbers, dates, etc are a bit different from masked.input\n"

When you start talking about dates, that's when it starts to cross over to validation\u2014something this directive isn't designed to handle. When you start offering those kinds of rudimentary validation use-cases to users, they're going to wonder why it's not more sophisticated (e.g., why it only works on individual characters). There are many better, purpose-built solutions for doing client-side validation of input data.\n\nThat aside, I agree that it would be nice to allow the user to specify that the model reflect the formatted view value. As for \"fixed\" non-mask characters, I think \"escaping\" is a term more would be familiar with, and I'd advocate for a simpler, more familiar backslash (\\) escaping of a mask character.\n"

The one with unreachable break in the switch is weird, it seems that jshint on one hand and my ide (webStorm) and coffee compiler on another have a difference in opinions as to what's the right way to do it here. Anyway, jshint seems to be happy now.\n\nThe external dependencies - yes, there is a dependency on JQuery. A list of what's needed of JQuery is in the comments in the header to the source code. Other than that there is no external dependencies.\n\nThe refactoring to eliminate the JQuery dependency - the thought occurred to me and I definitely want to do it. My question in regards to this is - what is the recommended way to do it? I was thinking of providing my own version of the necessary functions ONLY if there isn't one already available. In other words if the full JQuery is loaded I would like to use the JQuery version - is this how you plan to do it for the rest of the ui components?\n"

        "body": "Yeah... it's kind of a mess atm\n\nHere's the bottom line:\n\nAngularJS 1.1.x = AngularJS 1.0.x + new features\n\nThere will **not** be any regressions in the 1.1.x branch. Only the _new features_ are unstable. However, in that vein, utils is essentially just as unstable (if not more-so) and you're better off using the `ng-if` found in the core instead. It will also reduce the need to address bugs with an vestigial feature. If you want `ui-if` you will have to stick with an older version of utils.\n\nSorry, I realize this is a huge inconvenience but it's getting difficult to keep things beurocratic and run things without enough people.\n"

Unless I am missing something. \n\n@pocesar I also thought about something in regards to using ui-mask-placeholder. Since there is two entry points for:\n1. The placeholder\n2.  It's substitutions\n\nYou can run into a scenario where a substitution placeholder does not match the actual placeholder itself. Example:\n\n```\n<input ui-mask=\"9999/99/99\" ui-mask-placholder=\"Y-Y-M-M\">\n```\n\nClearly not ideal.

But the weird thing is that when I actually test this code in Firefox and Chrome, it only includes the partial content once (no infinite loop). Why it does not recurse has me pretty confused, and that's how this issue slipped right past me.\n\n#85 should resolve this, by refactoring the partials into a separate file 'include-partials.html'.\n\nAnother question is raised here: what should happen when fragment is specified, but its value is falsey or invalid (not a string)? I'm inclined that it should include nothing (unlike what it does now, which is to include the whole document).\n"

Is there a good reason really to separate the watcher into two functions like this? Already it is causing more complexity and has a few bug regressions.

I reverse engineered the jQuery code to implement what I needed. I also put some tests to make sure that I did it right, I ran the tests successfully on IE8, IE9, Firefox 20 and Chrome 28. \n\nI am not sure how sure I can (or should be) about other platforms, because of this I implemented my own versions of necessary methods in a separate file and in such a way that they will only kick in if the implementations are not already there (i.e. because the jQuery is already there).\n\nBefore I port this to javascript can you please have a look at the way I did it in my [repo](https://github.com/Hill30/NGScroller) just to see if you agree with the approach. Read the [dependencies](https://github.com/Hill30/NGScroller#dependencies) section I just added. in the Let me know\n\nWhich brings one more question. Does it make sense to turn the jqLite extras in a component of its own? Just a thought\n"

        "body": "We have experienced a similar error.  In our specific case the error seems to be related to creating a custom directive that has an <input> tag inside of it that makes use of the ui-date directive and ui-event directive to capture blur events.  \n\nWhen you chose a date the code in ui-utils-event.js (https://github.com/angular-ui/ui-utils/blob/master/modules/event/event.js) will execute and the error will occur.  It looks like the reason for the error is line 22 which is doing a check of !$scope.$$phase before calling $scope.$apply().  However it seems that $scope.$$phase is not being kept up to date with $rootScope.$$phase as the error then occurs because the ui-utils-event.js code will check $scope.$$phase and not see that the $apply phase has already started and will call $scope.$apply(), then in the $apply function a second check is made but this time the code checks $rootScope.$$phase (done in function beginPhase called from function $apply) and will see that an $apply phase is already started and will throw an error.\n\nWe think the issue could be solved by changing the check in ui-utils-event.js to !$rootScope.$$phase.\n\nHere is a jsfiddle with the issue.  You will need to have your console open to see the error:\nhttp://jsfiddle.net/PLM8v/6/\n"

This is essentially the equivalent to using this lib, which is far more unstable and slower to maintain. If you don't use any of these new features (excluding ngIf) there will be no difference in the codebase.\n\n`ngIf` is here to stay however (or at least to my knowledge). Again, 1.1.x contains all the same bug-fixes and stability of 1.0.x, it just _also_ has additional features.\n\nIn the end, you're much better off getting `ngIf` since it has proper integrated support for things like animation, is actively maintained and fixed (unlike this module) and is probably as far along if not farther than this module.\n"

        "body": "Finally had a chance to look at it.\n\nSo here's my thoughts:\n\nMaybe it should be called <del>`ui-scroll`</del> <del>`ui-scrolled`</del> `ui-scrollpoint` instead of waypoints, since that's more accurately what you're paying attention to inside the directive.\n\nDon't use a super confusing and complicated API. I totally applaud your efforts to be simple and minimal, but if anything, I would strip out functionality and just provide building blocks that people can use to mix and match and reach their original goal. Don't handle strings and ints and objects and functions and ints with special string characters differently, etc. What if I wanted to specify a custom class, AND a function, AND an offset? You're just making more work and maintenance for yourself in the long run.\n\nFirst, one thing I think most of the team has learned is don't ask people to provide functions by name that you pass hard-coded parameters to. Instead provide scope variables like we do `$event` and let people execute whatever expression they want.\nSo instead of `ui-waypoint=\"someCallback\"` we would do `ui-waypoint=\"someCallback($direction, $element)\"`. Of course, I'm not saying this is what I think the final API should be...\n\n### CONTINUING!\n\nI don't think providing `$element` (or a handle to a DOM element in a controller/scope callback function) is a good idea. You're blurring the lines that angular spent so much effort to create. If someone wants to fuck with the original DOM element, then have them write their own directive (that possibly wraps yours). Ask yourself what they would REALLY want with it? I'm guessing you were trying to provide the coordinates of the DOM element, because everything else could be stored on the scope. If that's the case, maybe just provide a `$position` object or something, although this is something I believe needs more thought and is an issue on several other directives too.\n\nSIMPLIFY!\n\nInstead of trying to explicitly support `ui-scrollfix`, which is an archaic and oddly specific directive, provide people with building blocks and examples of how they go together. For instance...\n\nInstead of `ui-waypoint` or `ui-waypoint=\"'someClass'\"` demo something like this: `<div ui-waypoint=\"fixed=($direction=='up')\" ng-class=\"{fixed:fixed}\">`\n\nKeep in mind, people can even create alias directives that are essentially what I just typed in ^ (checkout [ui-alias](126)).\n\nAnyway, perhaps what we want is a simple way to hook into scroll events, but the question becomes what is the criteria? Is it when the DOM element touches the top of the screen? or is it when it exits the screen? Does direction matter? Should we calculate offset? ETC.\n\nIf you can provide a concise API that tackles 80% of what waypoints does AND allow me to roll my own ui-scrollfix directive, then we all win.\n\nI reviewed the base jquery plugin and had a few thoughts:\n1. $direction is cool, but do you really use it? Maybe it's an unnecessary amount of bloat to bother calculating?\n2. What if we just had an 'in' function and 'out' function? Similar to 'up' or 'down'? Again, this might not be as good as your approach with $direction, or maybe bothering to support more than 1 event isn't even worth it?\n3. We probably should just let people specify an offset as an additional attribute.\n\nPerhaps `ui-scrolled` or `ui-waypoint` isn't a good description... maybe `ui-scrollpoint`? Since it's about when you scroll to/past this point? I just think that people won't get where `waypoint` originated from if they weren't familiar with the plugin (like I was).\n"

        "body": "Thanks for the review! Here's a proposal for some changes, what do you think?\n\n### Summary\n- Rename ui-waypoints to ui-scrollpoint\n- Make an API that looks like `<div ui-scrollpoint=\"<expression>\" [ui-scrollpoint-options=\"<object expression>\"]/>`\n- Pass $direction and $position as scope elements while evaluating the expression (no more $element)\n- I'll review the pull requests and integrate the fixes\n\n### Rationale\n\nI'll start off describing the particular use case I have for this module and then respond to your comments. I had a customer who wanted a fixed navigation that fixes itself to the top of the screen when you scroll past it, and highlights each link in the navigation as you scroll past it on the page. So I wanted something that would fire a callback whenever the appropriate points were passed on the page so that I could add/remove classes from the navigation.\n\nNow onto your comments. Agree about the name being not very descriptive. I picked waypoints so people could find this module if they are looking for functionality similar to the jquery waypoints module. Happy to change the name though, as I agree ui-waypoints doesn't describe what it actually does very well.\n\nI really like the idea of having syntax such as `<div ui-waypoint=\"fixed=($direction=='up')\" ng-class=\"{fixed:fixed}\">`. That is nicely concise and general. The tricky part for that is establishing the best way to pass options like the offsets and whether or not to dynamically update the position of the dom element. Maybe attributes are the best way? That's what I would lean toward at least, but it seems like `<div ui-waypoint=\"expr\" ui-waypoint-someattr=\"otherExpr\" />` feels a little bit ugly. I can't think of anything better though, at least nothing that would keep the simplicity of just providing an expression to evaluate as the primary interface.\n\nI think we need $direction (or equivalent) because it lets you do things like remove a class when you scroll up past it and add one when you scroll down past it (my use case). \n\nGetting rid of $element and replacing it with $position is a good idea (you were right about the reason I was passing it).\n"

        "body": "### New Feedback\n- I changed my mind about `$direction` and `$position`. What are you using `$position` FOR exactly? Do we really need it? I think we should keep `$direction` but drop `$position`\n- To improve performance, lets lazy-bind a maximum of 1 scroll event to $window. Make a collection of 'bindings' and have 1 actual DOM binding to $window that iterates through the collection to see if there's logic that needs to be executed. The collection and window binding can be built up on first instance and torn down when the collection is empty.\n- To allow scoping to scrollable DOM elements, we can have an optional parent `ui-scrollpoint-container` directive that overrides the binding from `$window` to whatever the DOM element is. This needs testing, as I'm not sure if this necessary, do overflow:auto/scroll containers have/need their own isolated scroll events?\n- The only 'option' I think we need to really support is offset. This could be similar to the current scrollfix accepted values. \n\n### Examples\n\nHow to recreate 3rd party plugins using this as a tool.\n\n#### ui-scrollfix\n\n``` html\n<div ui-scrollpoint=\"fixed=($direction=='down')\" ng-class=\"{fixed:fixed}\">\n```\n\n#### Scrollspy (bootstrap)\n\nThis may take a bit more boilerplate, but by applying the scrollpoints to the DOM you want to spy on you don't have to worry about timing issues and race conditions like having the spied DOM being created late (such as putting the nav in the header vs the sidebar and supporting 1 page per primary nav item and still spying on children).\n\nKeep in mind in this demo, `$direction` is not as useful since `active` can only have 1 value at a time, so there is no need to have a `remove()` expression.\n\n``` html\n<ul>\n  <li ng-class=\"{active:active=='item1'}\">Item 1</li>\n  ...\n</ul>\n\n...\n\n<h1 ui-scrollpoint=\"active='item1'>Item 1</h1>\n```\n\nCombine scrollspy demo with scrollfix demo and you have the full Bootstrap implementation.\n"

        "body": "All sounds good to me. \n\nOne last concern. There is a slight mismatch of semantics for when the event is fired between scrollspy and ui-scrollfix. ui-scrollfix checks where the position is on compile, while scrollspy checks it each time a scroll event occurs. What this means is that if you assign position: fixed to an element, if you're using the scrollspy method, you'll never get another trigger because the position no longer has a fixed offset. There are three ways to deal with this that I can think of:\n- Rely on the user to set a static offset for this situation\n- Provide an option to set which way it triggers\n- Introspect the element to figure out when it's fixed position and automatically adjust (this sounds brittle)\n\nAny preference?\n\nI'll start working on the other changes in the meantime.\n"

This code is identical to scrollfix, except that the behavior is NOT to change to pos:fixed but instead to simply change the value of a scope variable.\n\nIn other words:\n\n``` html\n<!-- The nav list has a binding to handle floating -->\n<ul class=\"navigation\" ui-scrollpoint=\"fixed=($direction=='down')\" ng-class=\"{fixed:fixed}\">\n  <li ng-class=\"{active:active=='item1'}\">Item 1</li>\n  <li ng-class=\"{active:active=='item2'}\">Item 2</li>\n  ...\n</ul>\n\n...\n\n<!-- Each nav item on the page has it's own binding to change the active nav item -->\n<h1 ui-scrollpoint=\"active='item1'\">Item 1</h1>\n...\n<h1 ui-scrollpoint=\"active='item2'\">Item 2</h1>\n```\n\nAll calculations for the nav and the items are identical, whatever they may be.\n\nHowever, a new issue has just occurred to me. If you set the nav to pos:fixed when the $direction is down, how will you set it back when $direction is up\n"

        "body": "I got what you meant about the API, and think that's a good way to do it. I'm talking about the issue you mentioned at the end.\n\nui-scrollfix remembers the offset that the element has at compile time and never touches it again, so even if you add pos:fixed to it, it will remove the class whenever you pass the original point that the div was when the page rendered. scrollspy updates the element offset on every scroll event, so if we use that approach, it'll either never get another event once it's assigned pos:fixed (which for our example means $direction will never be up, so fixed will never be false), or it will thrash back and forth, unless the user explicitly sets the offset to fire on. I.e., if the nav is at offsetTop = 100, the user scrolls past it, and assigns `position: fixed; top:0px`, then offsetTop = 0, so the event will not fire again at pageYOffset = 100, as the user probably would expect.\n\nAlso, I think the expression would need to be a little more complicated to get exactly the behavior the scrollspy provides. Scrollspy would essentially assign \"active='item1'\" immediately when you scroll up past item two, so we'd need something more like\n\n``` html\n<h1 ui-scrollpoint=\"active='item1'\">Item 1</h1>\n...\n<h1 ui-scrollpoint=\"active=$direction=='down' ? 'item2' : 'item1'\">Item 2</h1>\n```\n"

This lets you prevent a page (or state) from loading until a resource has been retrieved, and you can nest chunks of your application and load assets at every chunk level.

I added this directive to a project today and have some questions/feedback:\n\nIf I use this on a dropdown menu (a popular use-case for hover intent behavior), I don't see a way currently to make the menu disappear on mouseout. Maybe I'm missing something. \n\nI thought this would be an Angular implementation of the popular jQuery hoverIntent plugin (https://github.com/briancherne/jquery-hoverIntent). If that's not ever the plan, that's okay, but maybe a name change would prevent some confusion? \n"

The reason I created is that I needed it myself, and it didn't exist yet.\nI know and have used the jQuery plugin, it is also where I got the name from.\n\nHowever, Angular is not jQuery, and that is why things work slightly different. For example the menu use case (which is actualy the usecase I needed hoverIntent for) can be solved as follows:\n\n``` html\n<nav ui-hoverintent=\"menuOpen=true\" ng-mouseleave=\"menuOpen = false\">\n<!-- Menu Content -->\n</nav>\n```\n\nIf you have any more questions, let me know.\n"

It would regenerate the mask as the user types. since the user can't \"skip\" the carret, would make sense to make it realtime as it types. For example, the phone example I used, S\u00e3o Paulo area code is 11, so as soon the user fills the mask (11) the mask changes to (11) 99999-9999, if its (19), it changes back to (19) 9999-9999\n> \n> and btw, that regexp mask using an array of regex is really clever! that solves a lot of problems with complicated patterns and still make the mask functional.\n\nAnyone has an alternative to use for the exampe case of S\u00e3o Paulo phones?\nI can't figure out a solution for this...\n"

However, you're right, the one which deals with promises does return false when the function validates to false. So I was really just throwing the info out there to see what people thought.\n\nAlso, @blowsie could you elaborate on the test case you gave in this PR?  The example you gave doesn't fail with what's in master right now, I'm not sure if perhaps there was just a typo.  We actually picked up on this PR because we had to make the exact same change to get validation functions to return the invalid value after being validated as false.\n"

My ng-scroll-viewport and ng-scroll directives were within an ng-switch directive.  This caused a problem during page load, when the ng-scroll directive attempts to determine the calculated height of the scroll items:  the ng-scroll directive forced them to be non-visible with a resulting height of zero.\n\nIf I moved the ng-scroll outside of the ng-switch, it works properly.\n"

If somebody uses angular over jquery, jqlite is just a bloat. \n\nI can certainly merge them, but if some other component (scrollfix?) would need a method (element.scrollTop?) an implementation will have to be provided by this component, multiplying the bloat. May be it makes sense to turn the jqlite into an extension library of jquery free implementations of some jquery methods to be used across angular ui components. \n\nSee also some discussion at the end of this thread: https://github.com/angular-ui/ui-utils/pull/51\n\nWhat do you think?\n"

Something that would allow a user of scroll (or anything similar) to include (or not include if jQuery is present) the entire jqlitePlus module. What extras would go into the module though can be determined by the dependencies defined in bower.json of the components. This way the bloat would be minimized while the use would be real simple \nUnfortunately I got pulled in a different direction at the moment, but I will play a bit with this approach and let you know \n"

Again, this would be most useful if your validation requires a call to the server - reduces the 'chattyness' of the system.\n\nThanks for getting back to me.\n"

If so, isn't that not good for critical bugfixes that need to be pushed to peoples bower components?\n> If it's unintended behavior, I presume it's because bower's version probably just looks for the first commit of a version it is looking for.\n\nYes but you can ask bower to directly follow the master.

        "body": "@mfeingold Thanks for that! It looks like the css has `.ng-scroll-viewport` instead of `[ng-scroll-viewport]`, which did fix the error. Cheers for that.\n\nTo offer a bit of feedback from a green user who actually bothered to read that document, and not for the sake of discrediting that great find, the documentation does not say it _must_ be constrained. It states:\n\n> Important: The viewport height has to be constrained because the directive will stop asking the datasource for more elements only when it has enough to fill out the viewport. If the height of the viewport is not constrained (style=\"height:auto\") this will never happen and the directive will try to pull the entire content of the datasource.\n\nIn summary, it says if it's not constrained, it pulls the entire contents of the data source (nothing about an error). This is also untrue in the case of the body, which works fine with or without a height constraint, which makes this paragraph even less credible.\n\nAnd last but not least, I'll just go ahead and suggest that `Cannot read property 'documentElement' of undefined` could be improved upon greatly, and doesn't give any impression of a missing height attribute.\n\nHave a great day!\n"

        "body": "Thank you for your feedback. I agree, this paragraph deserves some editing. \n\nAs to the obscure exception - you also have a point. I can easily improve diagnostics for this particular case. Unfortunately, to make it really useful I would need to find a way to detect that its computed style height is 'auto'. There is no way to do that other than manually traverse hierarchy of both the elements and the css styles. At least I did not find any.\n\nIn other words if for instance you put some text inside the viewport div, the error will go away, but the scroller will still be useless - if you need full content, no need for scroller, use ng-repeat\n"

That helps get passed the frozen view that didn't want to update, but still doesn't update the model for the validation function.  It seems that one would want the model to update at the very least in some temporary way so that the custom validator can go to work on it.  Am I missing something?\n"

To follow your lead in using bower I was thinking about creating 2 separate branches - scroll-jquery and scroll-nojquery. The scroll-jquery branch would be for use in combination with jquery and would include only the scroll.js file. the scroll-nojquery would include both the scroll.js and jqliteExtra.js file. Unfortunately it does not solve the problem in its entirety. Also this introduces a new pattern to the repo structure which would be really beneficial only if the rest of the components would also follow it and I do not see it happening any time soon. \n\nIn other words I think of giving up on this nice idea and folding the jqliteExtra file into the scroll.

To keep the 'no external dependencies' promise you need either add an independent implementation of the position() method to ui-scroll-jqlite.js, or change implementation to relay on the methods already implemented there - would offset() work?\n2. My language of choice for writing the code is coffeescript. The coffescript scroller code is located [here](https://github.com/Hill30/NGScroller). If possible I would like to make changes there and then grunt build it and roll it over to angular-ui\n3. I was thinking about implementing this feature and I was thinking along the same lines you are. I just thought there should be a cleaner, more concise way to implement it - with no newRow flags, just some tweaking of the formulas in the ***clip methods\n"

I found that you really needed to be able to handle/detect a complete row change so when items are clipped/added the existing items didn't bounce around and you never had to handle any items \"left over\" in a row. I also found that handling newRow was very important in adjustBuffer. I'm open to any ideas, but that's what I came up with and it's working pretty well in my project so far.\n"

You docs state \"index indicates the first data row requested\"  the idea of a -ve data row sounds strange to me.  So why can't the code that calls the datasource.get method normalise index like this each time so you never have to deal with -ve indexes.  I can understand that it can't know the number of items in the list, so it can't do the end calculation, but why not the start ?\n"

The current code only uses the height of the first item in each row as the height to adjust the scroll offset buffer. To resolve the jumping the max height of each row would need to be tracked and that's what would need to be used as the offset adjustment. Notice how your sample smooths out after the multi-height items are scrolled away.\n"

Why would ui-validate be using the model value to do the validation rather than the value of the input control itself, like the regular angular validation?\n\nThere is a simple, but ugly, work-around, which is to make the ng-show take into account the other validation e.g.:\n\n```\n<div ng-show='myForm.confirm_password.$error.validator && ! myForm.password.$error.minlength' class=\"text-danger\">\n```\n\nBut shouldn't ui-validate be using the input value rather than the model value?\n"

Simply access the view value of the first `password` control in the ui-validate expression e.g.:\n\n`<input id=\"confirm_password\" ui-validate=\" '$value == myForm.password.$viewValue' \"` ...`\n\ninstead of the model value of it:\n\n`<input id=\"confirm_password\" ui-validate=\" '$value == password' \"` ...`\n\nThis solves the problem as it compares the view value of the password confirm field with the view value of the password field, which is a lot more intuitive and understandable than comparing the view value of `confirm_password` with the _model_ value of `password`.\n\nThen, if one wishes to display this only when the password field validates, one can add the additional check on the ng-show e.g.:\n\n`<div ng-show='myForm.confirm_password.$error.validator && ! myForm.password.$error.minlength' class=\"text-danger\">`\n\n(What I originally thought was a hack on the `ng-show` to take into account the errors status of the password field actually makes sense now)\n"

        "body": "@Snede - I'd have to run some test to be sure, but the logic I see behind it is as follows:\n- masking characters might get confused as input\n- the required directive parser runs before the other parsers\n\nWith a mask you have to tell the required directive: \"hey, even though there is stuff in the viewValue there isn't any actual data. This prevents masking characters from tricking the required directive into thinking there is user input in the control.\n\nThe second is the required directive parses first, then the rest of the parsers follow. This is, by design, the case with ui.mask. The required parser may run with the user input there and after the ui.mask parser runs the mask directive may remove the user input. But since the required directive parser has already ran, the required directive has no clue that the input has changed.\n\nAgain I would have to write and run some tests to be sure exactly what happens but that's how I see the logic.\n"

I haven't spent much time looking into it but if I call setCaretPosition a second time using setTimeout with a 50ms delay it makes it work 99% of the time, which is fine for the minimal usage it will get in my case. I should mention the issue happens consistently on 2 different android tablets in both the stock android browser and firefox on both.\n"

        "body": "So here is my analysis:\nIt seems the goal was for placeholder to act as the default format to show upon edit. However it doesn't allow for a normal placeholder that does not match the mask.\n\nI've hacked my way around this to make the default placeholder work. Using the most recent version from https://github.com/angular-ui/ui-utils/blob/master/modules/mask/mask.js I've commented out line 157:\n\n``` javascript\niElement.attr('placeholder', maskPlaceholder);\n```\n\nThis makes the normal placeholder appear on load, but it still messes up as soon as you focus. To fix this edit line 228-234. Change this:\n\n``` javascript\nfunction getPlaceholderChar(i) {\n    var placeholder = iAttrs.placeholder;\n\n    if (typeof placeholder !== 'undefined' && placeholder[i]) {\n        return placeholder[i];\n    } else {\n        return '_';\n    }\n}\n```\n\nTo this:\n\n``` javascript\nfunction getPlaceholderChar(i) {\n    return '_';\n}\n```\n\nObviously this removes the functionality to format the text according to the placeholder, but imo that should be done in an entirely different way.\nI'd like to see a real fix here by moving all the placeholder stuff to some ng- attribute and using that if it exists.\n"

        "body": "I just started using this library as well and have it mostly working. \nIt does start with 1, so decrementing the index before using it makes it easier to deal with zero-based lists. It also does get called with negative numbers, which some of the time you want to prevent, but some of the time you need to modify - otherwise you'll encounter the problem where you can't get back to the initial items in the list. It seems to stop requesting items when you return less items than were requested (as specified in the buffer), which is what you want to do when the list gets back to the top.  Here's the code I'm using: \n\n``` javascript\n                // make it zero-based instead of 1-based.\n                index--;\n\n                // If a negative, reset to start of list. \n                if (index < 0) {\n                    count = count + index;\n                    index = 0;\n\n                    if (count <= 0) {\n                        success([]);\n                        return;\n                    }\n                }\n```\n\nI think the way it works is that if you have a list with 17 items and a buffer size of 10, when you're scrolling down it will load the first 10, then the next 7 to get you to 17. It will then stop because you've returned < 10. Then when you're scrolling back up it's going to go from 17 to 7 and then -3. The code above handles the -3 by returning the 7 items starting at 0. It then stops again because you've returned < 10.\n\nHope that helps. \n"

If you set your cursor position anywhere in the middle of the input field and hit backspace it will automatically put the cursor position to the end. Likewise, if you enter any alpha characters it will put the cursor position to the end as well. This is because it always assumes the cursor position is at the end of the input. ui-mask counters this by setting the cursor position back to where the user had it. Hopefully that makes sense.\n"

We have created an issue within our main repo: https://github.com/Hill30/NGScroller/issues/64.\nThe temporary solution I can suggest is to block UI until the requested data has been loaded and rows have been rendered. This can be done via \"is-loading\" attribute.\n\nThe behaviour that was described in the 2nd issue is surely inefficient, but it is supposed to be that. If your app use cases are so that the scrolling (up + down) events are pretty often then I can recommend you to make a scroller data cache layer to reduce time needed for server responding. Here is the [demo of scroller data cache implementation](http://rawgit.com/Hill30/NGScroller/master/src/examples/cache.html). In current version there is no possibility to reduce time needed for rows rendering.\n"

But you cab use the default release for it. `bower install angular-ui-utils`\n\n<br>\n\nPS: @PowerKiKi It might be good to add those info to the README.md what you think ?\nPS: @PowerKiKi To work correctly when you want to release a new version you're suppose to tag the actual sources on the master with a tag `srcX.Y.Z` (see https://github.com/angular-ui/ui-utils/releases/tag/src0.1.1) then Travis it doing the rest (see https://github.com/angular-ui/ui-utils/releases/tag/v0.1.1) ?\n"

        "body": "SOLVED:\nI am using UI-Router and put clearOnBlur option to a scope variable which gets assigned in route view template like this (as described in pull request #164 ):\n\n```\n                <input class=\"form-control\"\n                       id=\"inputPhone\"\n                       name=\"inputPhone\"\n                       type=\"text\"\n                       required\n                       ui-mask=\"(999) 999 9999\"\n                       ui-options=\"vm.uiOptions\"\n                       ng-model=\"vm.order.phoneNumber\" />\n\n```\n\nWhich is not so good practice because that ui-router view doesn't get loaded  before user gets to that view...so I fixed it by defining that option globally instead of in view. (again as described in second part of #164 )\n\n```\napp.config([\"$provide\", function($provide) {\n    $provide.decorator(\"uiMaskConfig\", [\"$delegate\", function($delegate) {\n        $delegate.clearOnBlur = false;\n        return $delegate;\n    }]);\n}]);\n```\n"

My buffer was set to 8  (default value is 10).\n\nI'm not sure why exactly that was causing major issues, but as I scroll up it pops 4 off the bottom of the grid so I bumped my buffer down to 4 and viola.  Works like a charm.\n\nAlso, the documentation states that the <b>default padding</b> is 0.5, but when I actually set it as 0.5, I seem to get the appropriate performance that I was looking for (removal of blank space at top/bottom as you scroll).\n\nSo I'm a happy camper.  I would chalk this one up as purely a user error, and hopefully I can add any extra inspiration for documentation updates to elaborate more for future users.\n"

As soon as we are happy with the stability we transpile the code to JS and publish it here. I just merged  the scroller v 1.1.0 here from the https://github.com/angular-ui/ui-utils/pull/372.\n\nThe version in NGScroller repo is a little more bleeding edge for the price of a little less stability. \n\nAnd to answer the original question inline block/floated are supported since v 1.0.0\n"

I'm not using any of these, but in one project I have been doing replacement of \"bootstrap.js\" jquery based features into AngularUI Bootstrap directives which are pure Angular. But it is missing replacement for Bootstrap affix, atleast what I have been looking...\n\nSo this \"scrollfix\" would be almost the replacement for \"affix\" if it would provide a service with callbacks. And or, it would provide a way to add certain css class for element when scrolling has passed it.\n\nExample:\n&lt;div class=\"navbar navbar-default\" ui-scrollfix=\"200\" ui-scrollfix-class=\"navbar-fixed-top\"></div>\n"

This would be closer to Angular today, and feels less chaotic than bower branches, but may end up cluttering the AngularUI namespace(?).\n\nThoughts?\n"

And ui-scroll is in your error stack just because of nesting ti-autocomplete-match into ui-scroll. This is a [typical error](https://docs.angularjs.org/error/$compile/ctreq), but the reason is not obvious.\n\nBy the way with your 1st issue, it looks like some kind of race conditions over sources loading. The main question is does it necessary to use require.js? I'm sure that if you choose not to use this thing, the problem will disappear... Anyway you should deal with require.js I guess.\n"

As a proof I added _ng-if_ into _ti-autocomplete-match_ within your _ngTagsInput/auto-complete.html_ template:\n\n`<ti-autocomplete-match ng-if=\\\"item\\\" data=\\\"item\\\"></ti-autocomplete-match>`\n\nThis binding-pause trick resolves \"Controller can't be found\" issue and the view is ok. It is just an idea... and I'm still not sure that this is _ui-scroll_ issue. The problem with JQLite (Can't read prop length og null) is still happening but the error stack (with async section) leads us to _tags-input_'s kitchen and its blur event triggering.\n"

        "body": "@PowerKiKi honestly I didn't figure we need special 'builds' or 'releases' quite as much anymore since I wanted the modules to be kept separate, even while deployed. Most people with decent build systems bundle up all the vendor files together anyway. I just wanted to move the code of the still-relevant modules into their respective repos. I consigned a volunteer to help but he seems to have dropped off the map. I stubbed out blank repos for all the ones I felt were still relevant today (I also renamed ui-scroll to ui-virtualize as I felt it was more accurate and `scroll` might get reused too much elsewhere).\n\nAs for allocation of work? Uh... the sub-repos are not being used, so feel free to just dump code into them as you see fit. I would keep their build processes minimal however.\n"

In this case, I encourage any people who are facing this problem to just edit the only two affected lines of code. It's a very simple change, and has been used in production for almost a year now without issues.\n"

Utils alone has had a few other scrolling related directives. \n\nI suggested virtualize because I felt it describes more what the module _does_ and less about what causes it to happen (as I prefer to keep implementation specific grammar out of code as it's always subject to change). That said whatever name you land on I am (personally) fine with. \n\nAs for how you run your project, I have always tried to allow all projects to be fully autonomous and free to run themselves how they see fit while I have seen my role to be more of a consulting capacity where I give advice. Coffeescript is fine, it would be nice to drop it or pick up es6 instead as this is a standard,but not mandatory. \n\nThat said, I speak only for myself personally on all  these points , and others are free to disagree. \n"
