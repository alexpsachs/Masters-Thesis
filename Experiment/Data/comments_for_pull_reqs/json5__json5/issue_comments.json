        "body": "Great point.\n\nSomeone pointed me to [JSON3](http://bestiejs.github.com/json3/), which is still a regular JSON implementation, but which serializes `Date` objects to [ISO 8601 date-time strings](http://es5.github.com/#x15.9.1.15).\n\nInterestingly, it seems it doesn't do anything special to parse the generated strings back to `Date` objects. But maybe it's fine for that to be application-level logic, not sure.\n\nI thought maybe serializing to `Date(...)` could be an idea, but it turns out that in ES5 (see link above), calling `Date(...)` without `new` is actually supposed to ignore the parameters and always return the current date-time.\n\nThat leads to the thought of serializing to `new Date(...)`, but that strikes me as a bad idea, putting object construction in a data format.\n\nSo maybe the best thing to do is to follow JSON3 in at least serializing dates to a standard format. What do you think?\n"

(`npm install` is actually all that's needed, but `npm link` does that plus symlink it globally if you want to use it elsewhere. Not a requirement.)\n\n@ajlopez, it's good to know that `node test\\via-eval` runs without a hitch, but that doesn't actually run the tests \u2014 it just defines them. It seems the problem is running Mocha.\n\nCould you try running Mocha directly? Install it globally first via `npm install -g mocha`, then run `mocha --ui exports --reporter list`?\n"

I'm not sure that trailing decimals add any value along either of those lines.\n\nYou are right that ES5 allows them, but JSON5 just needs to be a subset of ES5; it doesn't need to allow everything that ES5 does.\n\nIt's a close call either way, and that's why I'm leaning towards disallowing them simply to err on the side of keeping the changes purposeful and meaningful.\n"

So I've implemented it as a separate file, thus requiring a separate require.\n\nI appreciate your support nonetheless!\n"

You're right that JSON5 probably shouldn't specify arbitrary or open-ended date string formats.\n\nI don't think using advanced types like that is a good either, though. The purpose of JSON5 is to be human-friendly when writing, and having to specify such things to help the machine parse your data defeats that purpose. =) It also greatly muddies the spec if we start reserving keys.\n\nLet's keep things simple here and stick to the \"no new data types\" philosophy, and for developer convenience, _this JS implementation_ will add an option to auto-try-parse all strings into JS `Date` objects, via @polotek's reviver.\n"

        "body": "Hey @Midar, apologies if I'm misunderstanding, but let me answer your question at the bottom first: the behavior for single quotes in the ES5 spec, as far as I know, is identical to double quotes. This is not like PHP or similar where escaping rules are different for single- vs. double-quoted strings.\n\nMaybe the confusion stems from the fact that Node is outputting the raw string value, when maybe you mean to be outputting the string that the user sees. Try using `console.log()` for that instead. Here's an example:\n\n```\n> console.log('\\foo')\n\noo\n> console.log('\\e')\ne\n> console.log('\\\\e')\n\\e\n> console.log(\"\\foo\")\n\noo\n> console.log(\"\\e\")\ne\n> console.log(\"\\\\e\")\n\\e\n```\n\nSeems to be working the same on my end and as expected. What do you think?\n"

The ES5 spec you linked for identifiers says:\n\n> A JavaScript identifier must start with a letter, underscore (_), or dollar sign ($); subsequent characters can also be digits (0-9). Because JavaScript is case sensitive, letters include the characters \"A\" through \"Z\" (uppercase) and the characters \"a\" through \"z\" (lowercase).\n> \n> Starting with JavaScript 1.5, you can use ISO 8859-1 or Unicode letters such as \u00e5 and \u00fc in identifiers. You can also use the \\uXXXX Unicode escape sequences as characters in identifiers.\n\nI'm unsure about this here:\nThe first part says it can start with a letter. The second part says that since JavaScript 1.5, Unicode letters are allowed and even \\uXXXX escape sequences. Now I'm wondering: Does that mean an identifier is also allowed to start with a Unicode letter? It first defines letter as a-z and A-Z and then redefines it to include Unicode, so I'm confused. Are the following valid identifiers?\n\n```\n{\u00e4bc: \"a\"}\n{\\u00E4: \"a\"}\n```\n"

Unicode \"digits\" can be used after the first character.\n\n> Are the following valid identifiers?\n\nYep. Node confirms this too:\n\n```\n> {\u00e4bc: \"a\"}\n{ '\u00e4bc': 'a' }\n> {\\u00E4: \"a\"}\n{ '\u00e4': 'a' }\n```\n\nHope this helps!\n"

For example, in my implementation arrays map to OFArray and objects to OFDictionary - both conform to the protocol OFCollection. So you can safely assume you got a collection - which a string is not.\n\nEdit: Maybe I should change it back though for compatibility - has it happened in the wild that a JSON file just contained a string or a number?\n"

In ObjFW, it's an OFNumber, but an OFNumber can contains a float, a double, an int, a size_t, etc. What it currently does is use an intmax_t for integers and a double for floating types.\n\nCurrently, it interprets 5.0 as a double and 5 as an integer. 5. would be a double then, while 5 would be an integer. It would actually make a difference if you go on and calculate something with it.\n\nYou can, of course, always convert it manually. The OFNumber class even has abstraction for that. For example, you call call [someNumber intMaxValue] and get an intmax_t - no matter whether it actually was an intmax_t or a double, it will just be converted if necessary.\n\nHowever, these types have different limits, so it might actually make a difference.\n\nWhat I also don't get about this is the inconsistency: Why would one allow .5, but not 5.?\n"

OFNumber's description method was using the printf format specifier %f for floating points which would kill the decimal point if unnecessary.

Is that indeed what Sencha Touch auto-generates?\n\nOne thing you could do to confirm is plug the generated JSON into e.g. http://jsonlint.com/ or http://jslint.com/ \u2014\u00a0does it indeed show up as invalid?\n\nIf so, maybe we should be reaching out to Sencha Touch instead to let them know they're generating invalid JSON...\n"

When I quickly scanned the tests in this repo, (json5/test/parse-cases/numbers), I didn't see a test for a hexadecimal float (just hex integers), so I assumed no one was doing it yet.\n\nSorry, my comment about 32bit bitwise operators was a bit confusing. I was thinking that the parseHexFloat() and toHexFloatString() functions would be written in pure javascript for portability. In which case I would expect the only reliable way to access the internal 64 bit representation of a number such as Math.tan(1), would be to use bitwise operations... but given that the bitwise operations are only 32bit in javascript, I am not sure it can be done. Maybe dividing by Math.pow(2,n) could be used to do shifts...? But I have doubts.\n\nEdit: In other words, how would you write the value of Math.tan(1) to a hexadecimal float string?  And how would you parse a string with a hexadecimal float into a Number using a typical browser's implementation of javascript?\n"

But === is not a sufficient test because it really just testing within the number's tolerance. It's still possible to loose information by serializing and deserializing using just javascript's Number.toString and parseFloat().\n\nI think it may be possible to avoid loss in precision... but it won't be trivial via pure javascript.\n"

The current behavior of outputting regular/strict JSON with stringify() was actually a purposeful design decision: the output is then readable by existing JSON parsers.\n\nAnd indeed, much of the feedback after release was around the importance of maintaining interoperability to help adoption. We're breaking it with parse(), so it'll help to preserve it with stringify().\n\nIt also gels with JSON5's purpose: to help humans write JSON (by hand) more easily. If you're outputting JSON programmatically, it's probably worth adding a bit of verbosity in order to maintain interoperability.\n\nThat said, it might be nice to implement what you suggest as an extra, to help with things like conversion tools. I probably won't be able to get to this anytime soon, so if you want to take a stab, a pull request would be welcome!\n"

Would that work for you?\n\nOptionally or additionally, perhaps the compiler could warn or throw an error if it encounters newline usage _not_ like this. But that might be unnecessary.\n"

For example:\n\n``` javascript\nvar original = [,,,];\nvar stringified = JSON.stringify(original); // \"[null,null,null]\"\nvar parsed = JSON.parse(stringified);\n\nassert.strictEqual(parsed[1], original[1])\n// AssertionError: null === \"undefined\"\n```\n\nUsing `null` place holders _is_ an improvement, but I'd rather see it just be empty. I went back to your README which seems to be a sort of \"mission statement\" for this project. It says:\n\n> It remains a strict subset of JavaScript, adds no new data types, and is a strict superset of existing JSON\n\nThat being the case, it seems this should be acceptable.\n\nIt is the only representation that allows it to be `stringify`'ed & `parse`d back while maintaining the **original** representation.\n\nOne other thing to point out to anyone that comes along and reads this: To hold true to how Javascript handles`[,,,]` means that the parser needs to count the last one as a \"trailing comma\" and **not** increment the length.\n\n``` javascript\n[,,,].length; // 3\n[1,2,3,].length; // 3\n[1,2,,4].length; // 4\n```\n\nThanks for considering it!\n"

I think it's fine to have an incomplete implementation, as long as it's clearly documented. (E.g. this JSON5 implementation itself doesn't support Unicode characters in key names yet.)\n\nSo let's keep that in mind and document both the readme and changelog appropriately.\n\n> The replacer argument (2nd) is not implemented. I don't plan to implement this one since it seems a bit esoteric to me.\n\nIt has some utility, and I've seen it used in a few places. E.g. https://gist.github.com/mikeal/2504336\n\nLike the above, that doesn't have to be implemented today, but we should still plan on it I think. The good news is it shouldn't be too hard to (eventually) implement: it's ultimately just calling a function on every key-value pair. =)\n\n> But, feedback is welcome up until this point.\n\nThe community would be the best source of feedback. Unfortunately at the moment we don't have a channel to easily reach the community. I had started a Google Group way back when, but never shared the link:\n\nhttps://groups.google.com/group/json5\n\nFor now, I'll at least add a comment to the issue requesting this feature, where several people +1'ed, but let's look to make the Google Group a thing going forward. I'll add it to the readme!\n\nNice work again. =)\n"

I don't really remember when I needed to represent any numbers.\n\nIt is a theoretical issue, number theory.\n\nIf you restrict representation to any real number, you have a field, which means for every number a and b you can always represent a+b and a-b. But you can't really represent a*b and a/b.\n\nThat's where Infinities come in. If you restrict representation to any real number, Infinities and NaN, it should be a ring, which means you can represent all operations (a+b, a-b, a*b and a/b).\n\nBut if you add Infinities without a NaN, you'll have neither. you can't represent a result of Infinity-Infinity, and you can't represent a result of Infinity/Infinity. So when somebody writes \"a-b\", he can't be sure if he will get a number.\n\nThat's why from mathematical point of view current situation really makes no sense. And the same reason is why all programming languages having Infinity also have NaN.\n\nPS: null is not a replacement for it:\n1. `typeof(NaN) === 'number'`, `typeof(null) !== 'number'`\n2. `null + 1 === 1`, `NaN + 1 !== 1`\n"

In other words, you can't possibly make so both these assertions are true while preserving current Date.toJSON() serialization:\n\n``` javascript\nvar x = new Date();\nvar y = String(x);\nassert.deepEqual(x, JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(x)));\nassert.deepEqual(y, JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(y)));\n```\n\nJSON fails first one, reviver suggestion fails second one.\n\nIs that important so you convert a date to JSON5 and back, and get the same date object again?

JSON will stringify NaN and Infinity to null.\n\nYeah, initially I wanted to write \"this is json5, this is corresponding json\", but I got this exact issue. Then I thought \"hey, I'm using yaml anyway, so why do I need json at all\"?\n\nSo tests are written using YAML. It supports infinity using `+.inf` syntax, so if target platform supports yaml, you can just compare `output` with the result of `JSON5.parse(input)`, and it should work.\n\nIf someone converts it all to json, NaN's would be lost of course, so it would be a special case. Maybe do a `JSON.stringify(JSON5.parse(input)) == JSON.stringify(output)` check or something.\n"

        "body": "I have thought on this for a while.\n\nI see two main user groups:\n1. Services generating/consuming JSON that want to pass dates around (especially without defining field schema in advance)\n2. People writing JSON by hand (configuration, complex command-line args, etc)\n\nMain problem with strings is that you have to define common schema between sender and receiver. Since only dates need that, it is a really weird limitation. Another problem is that in JavaScript, your JSON object would not represent the same JS object, so either you have to do postprocessing, or include schema support in JSON lib, or do some random hacks based on string format (similar to what MS does).\n\nHere are the options I see for non-string solutions:\n1. Push for ISO-8601 date literals in JS vNext (e.g. ES7). This works well for both groups, but obviously hard to do and with unknown timelines.\n2. Parse `new Date(\"ISO8601String\")`. Literally hardcode this on the parser level, so `new` with  anything else or non ISO8601 string parameters are a syntax error. This is valid JS, and works well for web services, but kind of annoying to write manually.\n\nI would much prefer option 1, but if it not realistic, I think that option 2 is a good substitute that solves problems with string approaches.\n"

        "body": "From the [json.org](http://json.org) website (emphasis mine).\n\n> JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) is a lightweight data-interchange format. It is **easy for humans to read and write**. It is easy for machines to parse and generate. It is based on a subset of the JavaScript Programming Language, Standard ECMA-262 3rd Edition - December 1999. JSON is a text format that is completely language independent but uses **conventions that are familiar to programmers of the C-family of languages**, including C, C++, C#, Java, JavaScript, Perl, Python, and many others. These properties make JSON an ideal data-interchange language.\n\nSo you see, the purpose of JSON is not just that it is language agnostic and fast to parse, but that it is also **easily readable and writable for humans**. JSON5 is a bit of a trade-off\u2014far easier for humans to manipulate, only marginally more complex for computers to manipulate. I think the benefits outweigh the cost.\n\nI think its best feature is how well if follows the [Principle of Least Astonishment](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principle_of_least_astonishment). Things you can do in JavaScript tend to just work in JSON5.\n"

[The grammar](https://github.com/aseemk/json5/wiki/The-JSON5-Grammar) (thanks @jordanbtucker!) is still concretely well-defined, and JSON5 is still ultimately a language-agnostic data format. (It just happens to be inspired by and a subset of JS in the same way that JSON originally was.)\n\nI can't speak to performance, because that's comparing apples to oranges right now. The implementation in this repo is an example one based on Douglas Crockford's original JSON implementation, but browsers and other platforms have native JSON parsers these days. One day I hope/expect we'll see a prototype of a native JSON5 parser; then we can compare performance. =)\n"

What are the options, and what are the pros and cons of those options?\n\nIt seems the biggest hurdle is that there is no standard way to determine what Unicode category a code point belongs to. For example, an identifier can start with `$`, `_`, or any character in the five _Letter_ categories or in the _Number, Letter_ category. That's 17196 different characters, all spread across the Unicode code point list.\n\nHere are some ideas on perhaps how to solve this:\n- [Require](https://www.npmjs.org/package/unicode) a [dependency](https://www.npmjs.org/package/unicode-categories) that [provides support](https://www.npmjs.org/package/unicode-data) for testing Unicode categories.\n- Bake in support for it yourself. I've already done some [prototyping](https://gist.github.com/jordanbtucker/c5a860338a6c4e3577ef) and [benchmarking](http://jsperf.com/js-isidentifier).\n- Consume Unicode escape sequences and forego testing them against appropriate Unicode classes, willfully violating the ES5 spec.\n- Something very obvious I haven't thought of yet.\n\nI think it's worth discussing the costs and benefits of implementing this support.

I can see where it could make your code cleaner, especially if you want to store a hash table using hexadecimal numbers as keys.\n\n``` js\n// ELF header\n// Source: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Executable_and_Linkable_Format#File_layout\n// { offset : fieldName }\n{ 0x00 : 'EI_MAG0',\n  0x04 : 'EI_CLASS',\n  0x05 : 'EI_DATA',\n  0x06 : 'EI_VERSION',\n  0x07 : 'EI_OSABI',\n  0x08 : 'EI_ABIVERSION',\n  ... }\n```\n\nBut this brings with it at least two issues that come to mind:\n1. The user must be aware that the keys `1`, `1.`, `1.0`, `1.00`, `1e0`, `1e-0`, `1e+0`, `1.e0`, `1.0e0`, `0x1`, `0x01`, ad infinitum all get stored as `'1'` in the object, and as such will overwrite each other.\n2. `JSON5.stringify` must either:\n   - parse keys to detect whether they are identifiers, numbers, or strings and output them appropriately, or\n   - output numeric keys as strings.\n     - In either case, the original representation of the key will be lost unless it conformed to the output of the [ToString](http://es5.github.io/#x9.8.1) method as indicated at the bottom of [ES5 \u00a711.1.5](http://es5.github.io/#x11.1.5)\n"

        "body": "Thanks @aeisenberg. I think I've been doing that, minus the cherry picking. What happens in the case where I want to include new commits from `develop` after I've already created my branch? For exmaple:\n\n```\ngit checkout -b cool-feature develop\n```\n\nDuring testing I realize there's bug that should really be its own branch.\n\n```\ngit checkout -b bug-fix develop\n# write code to patch bug\ngit commit -m \"bug squashed\"\ngit push origin bug-fix\n# create PR and merge into develop\n```\n\n`cool-feature` depends on that bug being fixed, so I want to pull the new changes from `upstream/develop` into my remote.\n\n```\ngit checkout develop\ngit pull upstream develop\ngit checkout cool-feature\ngit rebase develop\n```\n\nIs that wrong? When do I cherry pick? Should you just tell me to RTFM so I actually know what I'm doing? :)\n"

So it moves on to check for one of the `escapee`s, finding `\\r`. It appends an empty string to `string`, and moves on to the next iteration.\n\nNow `ch` contains `\\n`, but it doesn't know that there was a `\\` before the `\\r` that was before this character. so it will hit the check for `\\n` returning a `Bad string` error.\n\nI ran some tests to confirm this too.\n"

        "body": "I move to continue disallowing leading commas and empty values. And I apologize for the following novel. There's a TL;DR at the bottom. :)\n\nOne of the headaches of JSON is that it doesn't allow trailing commas. For instance, you start to write a JSON file, and like any normal JavaScript developer, you add a comma after each value because it makes it easier to copy and paste and move values around.\n\n``` json\n{\n  \"end_of_line\": \"lf\",\n  \"indent_style\": \"space\",\n  \"indent_size\": 4,\n}\n```\n\nOf course, JSON throws `SyntaxError: Unexpected token }` because of the trailing comma. This has led to hacks like adding commas to the beginning of each value except the first.\n\n``` json\n{\n  \"end_of_line\": \"lf\"\n  ,\"indent_style\": \"space\"\n  ,\"indent_size\": 4\n}\n```\n\nIt gets the job done, but it's ugly IMO, and it creates another problem. If you remove the first value and forget to remove the proceeding comma, you get `SyntaxError: Unexpected token ,`.\n\nFast forward to today. You start using JSON5 because trailing commas are awesome and should have been allowed by JSON in the first place. Even better, you don't have to change your current JSON files because JSON5 is completely backward compatible. And that's great because you have a lot of JSON files using the hacky leading comma syntax.\n\nYou edit one of your old JSON files, removing the first value, and you forget to also remove the proceeding comma because you're involved in several projects, overworked, and having trouble paying attention to detail.\n\nBut that's okay because JSON5 throws `SyntaxError: Unexpected token ,` when you try to parse it. Because you've seen it so many times with JSON files, you immediately know the issue.\n\n_Actually, JSON5 throws `SyntaxError: Bad identifier`. Remind me to fix that. :)_\n\n**TL;DR**\n\nIf JSON5 allowed leading commas and empty values, old JSON files that used to throw would no longer do so, which could introduce silent and/or hard to find bugs.\n\nAlso, `undefined` is its [own data type](http://es5.github.io/#x4.3.10), and, repeating for emphasis, JSON5 introduces no new data types over JSON.\n\nThoughts?\n"

        "body": "I wanted to open this back up for discussion, clarify some things, and see if we want to change this behavior.\n\n**TL;DR**\nThis issue was originally a bug because of a change in V8. Instead of fixing the bug, the feature was removed even though the feature didn't really have anything to do with the V8 bug. It was the implementation of the feature that needed a fix.\n\n**Signed numbers vs numeric literals**\n\nSigned numbers, whether decimal or hexadecimal, are not treated as _literals_ when parsed by ES5. They are parsed as two separate tokens: a [_Punctuator_](http://es5.github.io/#x7.7) (`+` or `-` in this case) and a [_NumericLiteral_](http://es5.github.io/#x7.8.3) (an _unsigned_ decimal or hexadecimal number).\n\nThat sequence produces a [_UnaryExpression_](http://es5.github.io/#x11.4) using the [`+`](http://es5.github.io/#x11.4.6) or [`-`](http://es5.github.io/#x11.4.7) operators. In either case, the text of the _NumericLiteral_ is converted to a number using ES5's [ToNumber](http://es5.github.io/#x9.3) operation, and in the case of the `-` operator, the mathematical value is negated.\n\nThe discrepancy between signed decimals and signed hexadecimals occurs within the [ToNumber(String)](http://es5.github.io/#x9.3.1) operation. It allows signed decimal numbers but prohibits signed hexadecimal numbers, returning `NaN` instead. Compare the following. (The global [Number](http://es5.github.io/#x15.7.1.1) function uses the ToNumber operation):\n\n``` js\n> [  eval('1'),   eval('0x1'),   eval('-1'),   eval('-0x1')]\n[ 1, 1, -1, -1 ]\n\n> [Number('1'), Number('0x1'), Number('-1'), Number('-0x1')]\n[ 1, 1, -1, NaN ]\n```\n\n**The V8 bug**\n\nThe `+` unary operator with a String argument (i.e. `+'1.234'`) also applies the ToNumber operation, which is what the [V8 bug](https://code.google.com/p/v8/issues/detail?id=2240) was about. Expressions like `+'-0xF'` and `Number('-0xF')` were resulting in `-15` instead of `NaN` as called for in the spec. Note that this is separate from the actual unary expression `-0xF`; this is the string `'-0xF'` being converted to a number.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nSigned hexadecimals aren't evil, nor are they disallowed in ES5. They just can't be converted from strings for whatever reason the ES5 authors had. This really has nothing to do with JSON5.\n\nJSON5 has freed us from the restrictions of JSON so that we can have a lightweight data-interchange format that is even easier for humans to read and write. Why disallow signed hexadecimals just because ES5 doesn't convert them from strings?\n"

But I'm not sure I totally buy this argument:\n\n> If JSON5 allowed leading commas and empty values, old JSON files that used to throw would no longer do so, which could introduce silent and/or hard to find bugs.\n\nBecause there are plenty of examples where invalid JSON (that would throw) is valid JSON5 \u2014\u00a0e.g. unquoted keys, comments, even trailing commas as you mention. =)\n\n\u2014\n\nI do agree that this still _feels_ like it'd implicitly be adding a new data type. Your suggestion of leaving the element types unspecified/\"empty\" is an interesting one though, @williamwicks.\n\nOn the notion of round-tripping, @jasons-novaleaf, I'm still a bit unconvinced, because both native JSON and JSON3 fail the round-trip test here too. So this isn't new to JSON5.\n\nAt this point, I'm in agreement with @jordanbtucker that I don't think we should add this.\n"

If this jQuery adapter is truly useful in practice, should we just add it to the bottom of the main `json5.js` file? (Because it also wouldn't be good practice to make a whole separate request for just five lines of code.)\n"

When JSON5 is serialized as JSON, it would output the date string, but when serialized as JSON5, it would output `new Date()` or `Date.parse()`.\n\nBTW, `new Date()` and `Date.parse()` are equivalent, so it comes down to which one feels better. I think my vote is for `new Date()` since it's two characters less.\n"

They'll fail if they contain those characters.\n\nI think it's more important for JSON5 to be backward compatible with JSON in this case. In other words, it's more important that JSON5 can parse JSON than that ES5 can parse JSON5. `eval` is strongly discouranged, so the only other time JSON5 would be parsed as ES5 is in JSON5P (working title) implementations and when the user copies and pastes JSON5 directly into their JavaScript.\n\nThis only applies to parsing strings, however. Whether we allow those characters in comments is up for discussion. I'm leaning toward keeping the ES5 standard and rejecting them.\n"

Bug filed with our rendering lib:\n\nhttps://github.com/malgorithms/toffee/issues/34\n\nTo be clear, this was programmatic JSON, not handwritten JSON5. The characters came from user input, probably copy-pasted somehow (as it didn't look malicious).\n\nI guess this issue boils down to these questions for me:\n- How often does (legitimate) JSON have these two characters?\n- How often are people parsing JSON5 as JS?

But after your comments, I started thinking about the difference between HTML and XML parsers. Does JSON5 need to have draconian error handling like XML, or can we take a page from HTML's tag soup handling book?\r\n\r\nIn this case:\r\n- `\\u2028` and `\\u2029` are technically valid in strings in JSON5.\r\n- JSON5 will parse `\\u2028` and `\\u2029`, and optionally give a warning.\r\n- JSON5 will escape those characters when stringified.\r\n\r\nIf you have a JSON5 file with those characters, and the contents of that file are in a variable named `file`, you can call `JSON5.stringify(JSON5.parse(file))` and you'll get back valid ES5 that you can inject into scripts.\r\n\r\nAnd you can do the same thing if `file` is regular JSON, too.\r\n"

Specifically, it doesn't support recursion, look-behind, directives, conditionals, atomic groups, named capture, comments, or embedded code. So, JSON5 cannot represent PCRE without breaking ES5 compatibility. Ultimately, this means that platforms that support PCRE wouldn't be able to serialize PCRE as JSON5.\n\nThe best way to serialize regular expressions is to convert them to strings.\n"

        "body": "I know that this issue has been long-closed, but I did want to express my preference for the other decision - repeating a key in a structure, as far as I can see, always represents an error or oversight of some kind, and it's a mistake I've made several times myself! I think it would be great if we returned to the original behaviour. This thread contains some interesting discussion: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/21832701/does-json-syntax-allow-duplicate-keys-in-an-object\n\nan interesting point being that whilst ECMA-404 doesn't say anything about duplicate keys, RFC 7159 says that they \"should\" not occur. It would be possible in time, I guess, to have a JSON5 standard that adopted one or other of these choices without saying that we had \"deviated\" from the JSON behaviour which seems to mostly result from accidents in parser implementation.\n\nI know this decision is unlikely ever to be revisited but I thought I'd put my opinion on record :)\n"

        "body": "@amb26 I'm in agreement with you that having duplicate keys in a JSON document is bad form. However, the major ECMAScript implementations\u2014V8, SpiderMonkey, and Chakra\u2014all allow duplicate keys. And they should, because according to the [official spec](http://www.ecma-international.org/ecma-262/5.1/#sec-15.12.1.1), once the parser validates that a JSON document conforms to the JSON syntax, it parses the document as ES5 ([almost](https://github.com/aseemk/json5/issues/70)). Note that [RFC 7159](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7159) only describes the structure of JSON documents but not the API and implementation requirements.\n\nAll this considered, one of the core values of JSON5 is being backward compatible with JSON\u2014in document structure, API, and implementation.\n\nI do see some value in logging a warning when duplicate keys are encountered, especially since JSON5 is meant for handwritten data documents where duplicate keys are more likely to occur.\n\nI appreciate your opinion and research on this matter and welcome any further comments. And don't be too quick to think that these issues won't be revisited. Just look at some of the [earliest](https://github.com/aseemk/json5/issues/1) [issues](https://github.com/aseemk/json5/issues/3) [for](https://github.com/aseemk/json5/issues/10) [this](https://github.com/aseemk/json5/issues/19) [repository](https://github.com/aseemk/json5/issues/36) and note how many times the community went back and forth on some pretty important features :)\n"

Namely `\\r\\n`, `\\r`, `\\n`, `\\x85`, `\\v`, `\\f`, `\\u2028`, and `\\u2029`.\n\nAll that said, I think we should remove the changes to whitespace from this PR and keep that as a separate issue. I've got more to say on that matter anyway.\n"

Granted, this PR only changes the CLI and not the core, so we could merge this now, but we should probably implement [Browserify](http://browserify.org/) before we start adding more dependencies. I [took a crack at it](https://github.com/aseemk/json5/pull/96) but ultimately had to [revert it](https://github.com/aseemk/json5/pull/99).

This won't break anyone's scripts\n\na) the command-line tool already uses `require()` to load the JSON5 module as a dependency, so it's fine to introduce an additional use of `require()`.\nb) you [already recommend installing the tool as an NPM package](https://github.com/aseemk/json5/blob/master/README.md#extras), so adding an NPM dependency doesn't significantly change the interface; `node` comes with `npm` on all platforms but FreeBSD.\n\nI can understand not wanting to move forward with additional dependencies without Browserify -- future contributors might want to use NPM deps in JSON5.js itself, and then where would we be? If that's the case, would I be better off publishing my own json5-tool package or something?\n"

        "body": "Thanks for this write-up. I agree with everything you've said. Here's what I'd like to see in this discussion:\n- Use cases (why we would implement this)\n- JSON5 document examples (how this would look in a file)\n- API (how we generate a document with constants)\n\nI can see how this might be useful in configuration files (similar to how LESS and SASS use them) but I'm struggling to see a data serialization use case.\n\nMy first thoughts on how this would look in a document is this:\n\n``` js\nvar e = 2.72;\nvar pi = 355/113; // using the new operator syntax in #111\nvar contact = 'Obi-Wan Kenobi <obiwan@jedicouncil.gov>';\n{\n  e: e,\n  pi: pi,\n  authors: [\n    contact,\n  ],\n}\n```\n\nFor the API, I have some questions. The API wouldn't be able to generate a document that uses variables. It could declare them, but not use them without some special function.\n\nMaybe it would work something like this. Add another argument to `stringify` (or modify an existing one to use some kind of [config format](https://github.com/aseemk/json5/issues/71#issuecomment-50880486)) and pass it an object of name/value pairs. The names must be valid identifiers or it will throw. Add a special JSON5 function (e.g. `JSON5.useConstant()`) that lets you use a constant name in your generated document.\n\n``` js\nvar options = {\n  quote_keys: false, // don't put quotes around keys unless required\n  quote: \"'\", // use single quotes\n  constants: {\n    e: 2.72,\n    pi: 355/113, // using the new operator syntax in #111\n    contact: 'Obi-Wan Kenobi <obiwan@jedicouncil.gov>',\n  },\n};\n\nvar doc = {\n  e: JSON5.useConstant('e'),\n  pi: JSON5.useConstant('pi'),\n  authors: [\n    contact: JSON5.useConstant('contact'),\n  ],\n};\n\nvar json5 = JSON5.stringify(doc, options);\n```\n\nFor the `parse` API, does it parse the constants into values before it gives it to the `revivier`, or does it notify the reviver that a constant was used?\n"

        "body": "Re: `JSON5.stringify` specifically: I might be forgetting some earlier discussions, but I still often wonder: what really is `JSON5.stringify`'s purpose \u2014 and what should it be?\n- The problem JSON5 set out to solve was \"make it easier and more human-friendly to write JSON out by hand\", with common use cases like config files and declarative data. \"Write\" == `parse`.\n- Tooling is a legitimate and great need: it's really helpful if tools can parse human input, amend it in some way, and output it back again. E.g. IDE auto-formatting, `npm install --save`, etc. But we'll never have this ability as long as comments are stripped, which `JSON5.parse` does. So if we really want \"parse the JSON5 document in its full original _syntax_\", `JSON5.parse` is not it \u2014\u00a0so `JSON5.stringify` shouldn't be considered the counterpart to it. (Another angle: as long as `JSON5.stringify` takes _data_, e.g. a JS object, and not a _syntax tree_, it doesn't serve this purpose.)\n- Similar to my point about variables, what problem is `JSON5.stringify` really trying to solve?\n\nThanks for the discussion again!

I would discourage adding `**`, etc., as those aren't standard ES5 either. (But I do appreciate them in CoffeeScript.)\n\nI totally agree here. Let's keep things ES5 compliant.\n\n@aseemk\n\n> Even with these basic operators, though, it does e.g. make supporting JSON5 in other languages harder. E.g. what is `5 / 0`? If we're to be consistent with ES5, it's `Infinity`. But in most languages, that'd be a runtime error. Or possibly an `undefined`-ish value.\n\nI'd alter that statement by saying that `5 / 0` is an error in most languages _if they're treated as integers_. ES5 doesn't have integers (all numbers are IEEE 754 floating point values) so this returns `Infinity`. If the numbers are treated as floating points, then most languages would return some form of IEEE 754 Infinity. (Python and Go are exceptions, however. Python always throws a `ZeroDivisionError`. The Go spec says it's [implementation specific](https://golang.org/ref/spec#Floating_point_operators), but the [official Playground](https://play.golang.org/p/vu1bb9FIip) throws a `division by zero` error. There are likely other exceptions, too).\n\n@piranna\n\n> I consider RegExp data, too... ;-) They are the same as function declarations as far as they are not executed, but function declaration would be beyond the line too not only because they are language specific but also could be dangerous if executed (RegExp are not dangerous in that way).\n\nOh no. Now the [RegExp discussion](https://github.com/aseemk/json5/issues/91) is bleeding into this one. :wink: I do see the parallels, though.\n\n@piranna\n\n> Infinity is a valid float value in all languajes, including C/C++\n\nMost languages have a way to check for `Infinity`, but not all languages have a way of actually representing that value (e.g. a constant that represents `Infinity` or a function that returns `Infinity`). PHP 4.0 is an example of this.\n"

If the numbers are treated as floating points, then most languages would return some form of IEEE 754 Infinity. (Python and Go are exceptions, however. Python always throws a ZeroDivisionError. The Go spec says it's implementation specific, but the official Playground throws a division by zero error. There are likely other exceptions, too).\n\nThis operations will not be executed on runtime but when parsed, so there's no problem the implementation wrap the operations on a try-catch block to capture these exceptions and set the value to infinite \"by hand\". Python support both Infinite and NaN, so...\n\n> Oh no. Now the RegExp discussion is bleeding into this one.  I do see the parallels, though.\n\nLol :-P Yes, there are parallels because it depends on the concepts of \"what is data\" and \"what is executable code\". After parsing we would get respectively a number or a RegExp object that both are not executables by themselves (a RegExp is a description that can be used to find some data, the same way a number can be used as an index on an array), so I would accept both. I would not accept functions because if they get parsed they are executables \"as is\", and there's almost no way to sanitize them and know they are secure (a RegExp could be bad written, but it's not a security thread or could erase data by itself...).\n\n> @piranna\n> \n> Infinity is a valid float value in all languajes, including C/C++\n> Most languages have a way to check for Infinity, but not all languages have a way of actually representing that value (e.g. a constant that represents Infinity or a function that returns Infinity). PHP 4.0 is an example of this.\n\nPHP sucks, but [not so much](http://php.net/manual/en/math.constants.php)... ;-)\n"

In Python, you can't just parse a `/` and perform division on the operands.

        "body": "It still seems that there is some desire to implement regular expressions as first class values in JSON5. So, I'm going to elaborate on why I think it's a bad idea.\n\n## Parsing\n\nI've already established that if you just treat everything between two `/` characters as a regular expression you'd have to use the native platform's regular expression parser to ensure it's valid. Bet let me entertain that idea and see how easy it would be to implement it.\n\nFirst, you'd need to make sure that at least one character exists between the two `/`s because `//` is a comment in JSON5.\n\n``` js\n//  <- comment\n/a/ <- RegExp\n```\n\nNow, what happens if you want to match a `/` in your regular expression? You need to escape it with a `\\` character.\n\n``` js\n/a\\/b/    // matches 'a/b'\n```\n\nOkay, so any occurrences of `\\/` should not terminate a regular expression. But what about this regular expression:\n\n``` js\n/a\\\\/    // matches 'a\\\\'\n```\n\nIt has an occurrence of `\\/` but the `\\` is escaped as `\\\\`. So we need to check for occurrences of `\\\\` and `\\/`.\n\nOkay, we're done, right? Well, what about this regular expression?\n\n``` js\n/a[b/c]d/    // matches 'abd', 'a/d' and 'acd'\n```\n\nIt's a valid regular expression with an unescaped `/` because it's inside an alternation group `[\u2026]`. So now we need to track when an alternation group begins and ends. Not so difficult, right?\n\n``` js\n/a\\[bc]d/    // matches 'a[bc]d'\n/a[b[c]d/    // matches 'abd', 'a[d' and 'acd'\n/a[bc\\]d/    // error: alternation group is never closed\n```\n\nOkay, so in the first example the `[` is escaped, but the `]` isn't because it only has special meaning in an alternation group. In the second example, the second `[` is not escaped but doesn't start new alternation group. The third example is self-explanatory. So, we need to check for `[`, `]`, `\\[`, and `\\]`, and treat `[` and `]` differently depending on whether or not we're in a alternation group.\n\nDoes that cover our bases? I don't know, but for the sake of argument, let's just say it does.\n\nLet's simplify this into a list of steps:\n1. When parsing a JSON5 value, if the first non-whitespace character is `/`:\n2. Peek the next character, and if it is `/`, parse a comment, and do not perform subsequent steps. (Otherwise, assume it's a regular expression.)\n3. Let _p_ = \"\". _p_ will store the regular expression pattern.\n4. Let _f_ = \"\". _f_ will store the regular expression flags.\n5. Let _a_ = false. _a_ will indicate whether we are in an alternation group.\n6. Let _c_ = the next character read from the stream of characters.\n7. If _c_ is `/` and _a_ is false, skip to step 14.\n8. If _c_ is `/` and _a_ is true, concatenate _c_ onto _p_, and return to step 6.\n9. If _c_ is `[`, set _a_ to true, concatenate _c_ onto _p_, and return to step 6.\n10. If _c_ is `]`, set _a_ to false, concatenate _c_ onto _p_, and return to step 6.\n11. If _c_ is `\\`, concatenate _c_ and the next character in the stream onto _p_, and return to step 6.\n12. If the end of the stream has been reached, throw a parsing error.\n13. Concatenate _c_ onto _p_, and return to step 6.\n14. Let _c_ = the next character read from the stream.\n15. If _c_ matches the [_IdentifierPart_](https://es5.github.io/#x7.6) production, concatenate _c_ onto _f_, and return to step 14.\n16. Try to instantiate a `RegExp` object with the arguments _p_ and _f_.\n\nStep 16 parses the flags according to the [ES5 spec](https://es5.github.io/#x7.8.5). This would allow implementation specific flags to be used (e.g. ES5 doesn't support the `s` flag, but does support the non-standard `y` flag).\n\nBesides the fact that this extremely minimal regular expression parser is still relatively complex, it doesn't actually _parse_ the regular expression. There's no way to validate the regular expression in an implementation agnostic way without writing way more code.\n\nWe would also need to define what happens if a platform doesn't support regular expressions or can't parse the regular expression given. It wouldn't know until it tried to parse it.\n\nSo, all JSON5 documents that include regular expressions would have to be late-validated, and there would be no true JSON5 validator.\n\n## Implementation Agnostic vs Implementation Specific\n\nLet's say we did implement a full regular expression parser according to the ES5 spec. It would no longer be implementation agnostic, and we would expect all implementations of JSON5 to parse JSON5 regular expressions into an ES5 compatible format on its native platform.\n\nFurther, by creating an implementation restricted parser you're castrating the more powerful regular expression engines supported by other platforms. No more named captures, no more comments, no more look-behind, no more recursion, no more `s` flag (dot matches new line).\n\n## Solution\n\n`JSON.stringify` serializes a `RegExp` instance as en empty object (`{}`). You can modify that behavior by executing the following line of code:\n\n``` js\nRegExp.prototype.toJSON = function() { return this.toString() }\n```\n\nThat's all you need to do to write code like:\n\n``` js\nvar emailRegex = /^([a-z0-9_\\.-]+)@([\\da-z\\.-]+)\\.([a-z\\.]{2,6})$/\nconsole.log(JSON.stringify(emailRegex))\n// output: \"/^([a-z0-9_\\\\.-]+)@([\\\\da-z\\\\.-]+)\\\\.([a-z\\\\.]{2,6})$/\"\n```\n\nAs an added bonus, that same line of code also applies to `JSON5.stringify` because JSON5 also checks for `toJSON()`.\n"

In fact, I've renamed and [re-opened the issue](https://github.com/aseemk/json5/issues/91#issuecomment-197391197). Let's keep further discussions there. Thanks.\n"

        "body": "> If implement RegExp or Date, the JSON5 can't convert to JSON.\n\nIf we embed RegExp or Date inside string, they are plain strings accepted by JSON, so no problem here. In fact, this \"trick\" is currently used on JSON sucessfully. The only thing is that JSON needs a special reviver function to interpret the strings that have embeded a RegExp or Date object, like https://github.com/piranna/ContextBroker/blob/master/lib/reviver.js\n\n> I have a other suggestion, create a package call json5-regexp or json5-date. And expose a use method in JSON5 to use json5-regexp middleware.\n\nNot a bad idea, but this would mostly host reviver functions if we want to still being compatible with JSON or with JSON5 implementations without support for this extensions. Also, if we use embeded strings this revivers could be used with plain JSON too...\n"

When the names within an object are not unique, the behavior of software that receives such an object is unpredictable. Many implementations report the last name/value pair only. Other implementations report an error or fail to parse the object, and some implementations report all of the name/value pairs, including duplicates.\n\nI don't think JSON5 should always output \"unpredictable\" JSON. However, if you would like to add that to your JSON5 files manually, you could do something like this:\n\n``` js\n{\n  note: 'THIS FILE WAS GENERATED BY A http://json5.org TOOL,\\\nEDIT THE .json5 SOURCE FILE INSTEAD OF THIS .json FILE',\n  anykeywhatsoever: 5,\n}\n```\n\nThe JSON consumer would need to ignore the \"note\" property in this case.\n"

(I wrote one of the first polyfills for new Date, and it was rather evil).  There are better fills for Date.parse out there, and in wider usage.\n"

The reality is that we _haven't_ shaken the boat with things like dates in all these years, so it's _probably_ unlikely that we will at this point either.\r\n\r\nSo there _could_ be some value in officially and formally \"freezing\" the spec... but I think there's also something to be said for learning from people's experiences and adapting to an ever-changing world.\r\n\r\nHow do others feel?"

        "body": "Hey @aseemk, a few thoughts:\r\n\r\n(1) If you freeze JSON5 that doesn't mean in 5+ years from now the lessons from JSON5 can't be taken and developed into a new spec (JSON22?).\r\n\r\nJavaScript will continue to change slowly, and someday it might be good to have another spec for easy to write JSON to keep up with it. But I actually think that process will go better in some ways if the specs are separate! Otherwise you end up in a very awkward period where a program may accept `.json5` documents, but you're not sure if you can use the new features or not.\r\n\r\nOf course, this will end your ability to make small changes, which I admit is a real downside.\r\n\r\n(2) If you think it's a good idea to move towards freezing JSON5 then it doesn't have to happen immediately. For instance, @jordanbtucker's issues are exactly the kind of thing that would be good to resolve first.\r\n\r\nWhat do you think?"

For one thing this puts us in a crappy place because we're stuck copying their made up language.\r\n\r\nIt still might be nice to have a description of JSON5 using an actual formal grammar. We would probably want to use Augmented Backus\u2013Naur because that's what's used in the [JSON spec](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7159#section-2). There are tools to turn Extended Backus-Naur into railroad diagrams, like in this project of mine here: [https://github.com/seagreen/Son](https://github.com/seagreen/Son), we could probably find such a tool for Augmented Backus-Naur as well.\r\n\r\nI guess the question is: if we had unlimited volunteer time and could write the spec in any language we wanted, would we go with the ES5 convention or ABNF? I can see advantages for both."

        "body": "The problem with formal grammars is that, while they're often meant for machine processing, the grammars don't always support the nuances of the languages they parse.\r\n\r\nFor example, ECMAScript allows [Unicode escape sequences in identifiers](https://es5.github.io/#x7.6) as long as the unescaped value can also be parsed as a valid identifier. In other words:\r\n\r\n```js\r\nvar a;      // valid identifier\r\nvar 0;      // invalid identifier (cannot start with a number)\r\nvar \\u0061; // valid identifier (\\u0061 = 'a')\r\nvar \\u0030; // invalid identifier (\\u0030 = '0')\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis is not something a lot of, if any, language grammars natively support. Take for example this [ECMAScript parser](https://github.com/bkiers/ecmascript-parser) written with ANTLR. Its [`IdentifierStart`](https://github.com/bkiers/ecmascript-parser/blob/a57e5c1e3912ef8fbb1d51eab93672280477a5b1/src/main/antlr4/nl/bigo/ecmascriptparser/ECMAScript.g4#L1008-L1012) production will parse any Unicode escape sequence regardless of whether or not it's a letter, `$`, or `_`.\r\n\r\nI proved this by forking it and adding a [test case](https://github.com/jordanbtucker/ecmascript-parser/blob/master/src/test/java/nl/bigo/ecmascriptparser/ECMAScriptLexerTest.java#L94) that should fail and then building it on Travis CI. All tests [passed](https://travis-ci.org/jordanbtucker/ecmascript-parser/builds/198617352).\r\n\r\nTalking specifically about JSON5, its grammar references some ECMAScript 5.1 grammar productions, which would have to be translated to a formal grammar language as well.\r\n\r\nYou're welcome to make a first go at writing an ABNF for JSON5."

        "body": "It's looking great! Thank you @jordanbtucker.\r\n\r\nOne thing I noticed: the license link is broken. I guess GH Pages doesn't automatically translate relative file links in this case, so you may need to explicitly point to `github.../blob/master/LICENSE.md`.\r\n\r\nSelfishly, I also realize now that my name is not explicitly listed anywhere! (Only the `package.json` example.) This isn't you; this is the case in the README directly too.\r\n\r\nI'm curious for your opinion: which of the below do you think is better?\r\n\r\n- Tweak the license line to say \"MIT &copy; Aseem Kishore and [others](https://github.com/json5/json5/contributors)\", like our actual [license file](https://github.com/json5/json5/blob/master/LICENSE.md).\r\n  _-or-_\r\n- Add my name to the \"Credits\" section? E.g. \"Aseem Kishore created this project and authored the first version.\" (And maybe link to the Hacker News reaction for fun\u2026 :trollface:)\r\n\r\nFeel free to make either change (both in your PR and on the master README), but I'm happy to do either also if that'd help.\r\n\r\nThanks again for the great work!"

There should be a mechanism in JSON5 customize the output a little bit.\r\nGoing through the JSON5 issues I learnt that JSON5.stringify used to generate standard JSON strings years ago.

        "body": "It would be great if you could clarify a few points on the web-page which are not obvious.\r\n\r\n* Can multi-line comments be nested? (I assume they may not be nested)\r\n  * No.\r\n* It says numbers may be prefixed by `+`. Does this also apply to `NaN` and `Infinity`? (I assume yes, `+NaN` and `+Infinity` are valid)\r\n  * Yes.\r\n* Numbers may have leading or trailing decimal separator. Is it allowed to have both leading and trailing decimal separator? Meaning: Is `.` a valid number? (I assume it is not)\r\n  * No.\r\n* Strings can now be single-quoted. What escaped characters are allowed in single-quoted strings? `\\'`? Is `\\\"` allowed in a single-quoted string? And is `\\'` now allowed in a double-quoted string? Any other extensions? EDIT: JSON allows an escape slash: `\\/`, does ECMAScript? What about `\\v` (not in JSON, but in ECMAScript).\r\n  * In strings, the following characters have special meaning when preceded by `\\`: `b`, `f`, `n`, `r`, `t`, `u`, `\\n` (U+00A0, line feed), `\\r` (U+00D0, carriage return). When the following characters are preceded by `\\`, they are treated as if they weren't: `'`, `\"`, `\\`, `/`. (Meaning `\"\\'\"` is the same as `\"'\"`.) This applies to both single and double quoted strings.\r\n* Object keys are, in JSON, strings. Can a multi-line string be used as a key in JSON5?\r\n  * Yes.\r\n* Unquoted object keys - is there any chance you can limit this to an explicitly specified character set without relying on some unicode support? Our library (https://github.com/taocpp/json) tries to be dependency-free and having to deal with unicode character properties seems to go against the simplicity of JSON (and hopefully JSON5). In fact, I'd consider alnums + `_` + `$` (without a leading cipher) to be good enough, if you want throw in more characters explicitly like `-`, `.`, ... but Unicode is way too much IMHO.\r\n  * Currently JSON5 only supports unquoted property names that follow the regex pattern `/[$_A-Za-z][$_A-Za-z0-9]*/`. To better align with ECMAScript 5, support for certain alphanumeric Unicode characters has been proposed. (`-` and `.` would not be included.) For an example of this implementation, see [jsonext](https://github.com/jordanbtucker/jsonext), which aligns with ECMAScript 6. Its [build.js](https://github.com/jordanbtucker/jsonext/blob/master/build.js) file generates regular expressions that match the Unicode characters allowed in property names."

In the literal `00`, the first `0` is treated as an indicator that the number is octal (base 8) and the second `0` is treated as the actual octal number, which results in `0`.\r\n\r\nIf you try this in ECMAScript 5 in _strict mode_, you'll get a syntax error indicating that octal literals are not allowed. And regardless of whether you're in strict mode, you'll get a syntax error if you try things like `00.0` or `00e0`.\r\n\r\nLike strict ES5, neither JSON nor JSON5 allow octal literals, so `00` is an invalid token. Interestingly in ES5, `08` should be a syntax error (even when not in strict mode) however many parsers just interpret it as the number 8, willfully ignoring the ES5 spec."

        "body": "OK, thanks.\r\n\r\nWhat about the free-standing grammar for JSON5? I think JSON5 would be great if it would stand on its own, referring to ECMAScript (5) might seem natural to you (and others that work with it), but it is completely alien to me (and possibly others that also don't use it).\r\n\r\nMaking it independent (and only taking care of being a (sub-set) of ECMAScript in the background) will likely turn it into a more concise and accessible standard. One which I already like, and I can only repeat my offer to help it grow to its full potential :) But ultimately, it is your decision."

        "body": "Okay, so I've gotten myself in a tough spot now. A draft of the JSON5 spec exists at https://github.com/json5/json5-spec, but the information I've been giving you is based on the reference implentation of JSON5, which doesn't completely follow the spec.\r\n\r\nIt is a goal of mine to align the reference implementation to the spec, but I haven't found the time. I think effort would be better used by aligning the reference implementation to the spec rather than writing a new spec based on the implementation. When complete, this would be JSON5 version 1.0 and the spec and reference implementation would likely be frozen at that point (with occasional bug fixes).\r\n\r\nHere is the only discrepancy I can think of between the reference implementation and the spec, but there may be others. According to the spec, strings allow any character to be escaped unless it has a special meaning. The characters that have special meaning are: `b`, `f`, `n`, `r`, `t`, `v`, `x`, `u`, `0`, `1` through `9` (which are errors), `\\r` (carriage return), and `\\n` (line feed). Any other character is treated as the character itself without the preceding `\\`. (For example, `'\\a'` is the same as `'a'` just like `\"\\'\"` is the same as `\"'\"`.) Taking after JSON, the JSON5 reference implementation only allows a subset of escapes and `v` and `x` aren't even included among them.\r\n\r\nThere is also some work to be done on the spec as listed at https://github.com/json5/json5-spec/issues/1"

        "body": "* Disallows trailing commas on empty arrays/objects. OK? (`[,]`, `{,}`)\r\n\r\n  * This is correct. A comma can only appear after an object member or array element.\r\n\r\n* Adding `\\0` and `\\xXX` as escape-sequences makes sense thinking about bytes, but JSON strings are required to be valid unicode strings - and those may not contain embedded nul-bytes IIUC. What is the intended semantics of those? Or does JSON5 allow \"binary\" strings, meaning any byte-combination is allowed? And if that is the case, what is the semantics of escaped surrogate pairs?\r\n\r\n  * The only Unicode code points that are invalid are values U+D800 through U+DFFF and values larger than U+10FFFF. This means that `\"\\0\"`, `\"\\x00\"`, `\"\\u0000\"`, `\"\\xFF\"`, and `\"\\u00FF\"` are all valid Unicode strings in ES5 and JSON5 (and the `\\u` versions are valid in JSON). So it's technically possible to store binary data in a string this way.\r\n\r\n    Although it's possible to store binary data as a string of character escapes, it's recommended to encode the data as Base64 and store the result as a string.\r\n\r\n    The string `'\\uD800'` doesn't represent a valid Unicode string because it's only half of a surrogate pair. JSON5 doesn't define how to handle this situation. I would encourage implementations to either throw an error or replace the character with U+FFFD.\r\n\r\n    Historically, strings and byte arrays were equivalent. The string `'abc'` was stored in memory and on disk as the byte array `61 62 63`. Likewise, `'\\x81\\x82\\x83'` was stored as `81 82 83`. So it made sense to represent byte arrays as strings. However, once Unicode became popular, strings started being stored in memory as UTF-16, so `'abc'` became `00 61 00 62 00 63` and when stored on disk or sent over the network, they were usually represented as UTF-8, so `'\\x81\\x82\\x83'` became `C2 81 C2 82 C2 83`.\r\n\r\n* Should the grammar be committed somewhere?\r\n\r\n  * Yes, please submit a PR to https://github.com/json5/json5-spec. Thanks."

I'm having trouble telling whether JSON5 is meant to be a superset of JSON or not. [This comment](https://github.com/json5/json5/issues/70#issuecomment-147766494) makes me think not, but the [ABNF](https://github.com/json5/json5-spec/blob/master/json5.abnf#L135) makes me think it is.\r\n\r\nEDIT: I just want to say again how excited I am JSON5 is moving towards a 1.x release.

        "body": "@seagreen Thanks for the commendation. Here's the relevant section from the WIP spec regarding line and paragraph separators.\r\n\r\n> **Paragraph and Line Separators**\r\n> Like JSON, JSON5 allows the Unicode code points U+2028 and U+2029 to appear unescaped in strings. Since ECMAScript 5.1 does not allow these code points in strings, JSON5 authors should avoid including them in JSON5 documents. JSON5 parsers should produce a warning when they are found unescaped in strings. JSON5 generators should escape these code points in strings.\r\n\r\nSo officially, JSON5 is a strict superset of JSON and a loose subset of ES5 (but only loose regarding line and paragraph separators). I updated that [comment](https://github.com/json5/json5/issues/70#issuecomment-147766494) to reflect this now.\r\n\r\nI haven't reviewed the ABNF with the new changes in mind, so I've added that to the [TODO list](https://github.com/json5/json5-spec/issues/1)."

Still a subset of JS/ES5 and standard, not one-off.\r\n\r\nEither way, I don't personally feel like this should be part of 1.0. IMHO, 1.0's primary goal should be to finalize & formalize what's already been there and what people have already been using. The rough edges you've been smoothing have been awesome! This feels like just a bit beyond the line from polish to new feature to me.\r\n\r\nAll that said \u2014\u00a0don't consider my opinion a show-stopper at this point!

Many of the changes are only formatting or rewording, but there are a few important changes.\r\n\r\n- Reworded the [introduction](https://github.com/json5/json5-spec/commit/33aee9941e56ed7a215cbc5c67498e54e6583aed) to state that JSON5 is a superset of JSON and removed the part about it being a subset of ES5 (https://github.com/json5/json5-spec/commit/3b5c1f1417b70f9c157cc1341a25b99114f6008d)\r\n  - Related to that, JSON5 doesn't add new data types to ES5, but it does add new data types to JSON, namely `Infinity` and `NaN`, so I removed that part too.\r\n- Fixed an error regarding what characters must be escaped in [strings](https://json5.github.io/json5-spec/#strings) (https://github.com/json5/json5-spec/commit/932a7d4a1e9cddda39e7215d1e8fdae9fec64d03)\r\n- Reworded the parts about [Infinity and NaN](https://json5.github.io/json5-spec/#numbers) and added an example (https://github.com/json5/json5-spec/commit/9a6aa9cdf706fe8f4738220824f5e9285c84dba3)\r\n- Refactored some [grammar](https://json5.github.io/json5-spec/#grammar) productions (https://github.com/json5/json5-spec/commit/f034fc028ff0cbcee444e915d497b798eab54275)\r\n  - The diff is a little confusing, but essentially I added a _JSON5Identifier_, _JSON5Null_, and _JSON5Boolean_ production to the lexical grammar and ensured that the syntactic grammar only references the JSON5 lexical grammar and not the ES5 lexical grammar.\r\n- Addressed octal [escapes](https://json5.github.io/json5-spec/#escapes) in strings (https://github.com/json5/json5-spec/commit/33aee9941e56ed7a215cbc5c67498e54e6583aed)\r\n\r\nThat last change also required a bug fix committed in c952a0d6e0f6fc285461c52cdd2d0f4952f6249c and 78b403a9ef60602741065907b032040dd9b780a5, which is live on npm at `json5@beta`."

(#1)\r\n  - Example: `{ \\u0061: true }` and `{ a: true }` are equivalent.\r\n  - Character and escapes can be mixed, so `{ abc\\u0064\\u0065\\u0066: true }` and `{ abcdef: true }` are equivalent.\r\n  - The code points represented by the escaped character must still conform to _IdentifierName_, so the following will fail: `{ \\u0000: true }`\r\n- New: In addition to the white space characters space `\\t`, `\\v`, `\\f`, `\\n`, `\\r`, and `\\xA0`, the additional white space characters `\\u2028`, `\\u2029`, and all other characters in the Space Separator Unicode category are allowed.\r\n- New: In addition to the character escapes `\\'`, `\\\"`, `\\\\`, `\\b`, `\\f`, `\\n`, `\\r`, and `\\t`, the additional character escapes `\\v` and `\\0`, hexadecimal escapes like `\\x0F`, and unnecessary escapes like `\\a` are allowed in string values and string property names.\r\n- New: When a character is not allowed in a string, `stringify` outputs a character escape like `\\t` when available, a hexadecimal escape like `\\x0F` when the Unicode code point is less than 256, or a Unicode character escape like `\\u01FF`, in that order.\r\n  - Example: `'\\u0061\\u0009\\u000F\\u01FF'` becomes `'a\\t\\x0F\\u01FF'`\r\n- Fix: `stringify` properly handles the `key` argument of `toJSON(key)` methods. `toJSON5(key)` follows this pattern.\r\n  - Raise your hand if you didn't know this was a [thing](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/JSON/stringify#toJSON()_behavior). :hand:\r\n- Fix: `stringify` accepts `Number` and `String` objects as its `space` argument.\r\n  - Related but different: #154\r\n- Fix: In addition to a function, `stringify` also accepts an array of keys to include in the output as its `replacer` argument. Numbers, `Number` objects, and `String` objects will be converted to a string if they are given as array values.\r\n  - Raise your other hand if you didn't know this was a [thing](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/JSON/stringify#Parameters) either. :hand:"

If I write a program that consumes JSON5 created by a generator, can I rely on those code points being escaped (AKA that the JSON5 will not actually be a superset of JSON, but rather an overlapping set?)

The use of the word \"should\" has the same meaning as in [RFC 2119](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2119).\r\n\r\n> **SHOULD**   This word, or the adjective \"RECOMMENDED\", mean that there may exist valid reasons in particular circumstances to ignore a particular item, but the full implications must be understood and carefully weighed before choosing a different course.\r\n\r\nSo, no you should not rely on this behavior, especially since the JSON spec does not recommend that generators escape those characters and JSON5 parsers must be backward compatible with JSON.\r\n\r\nThe old Bikeshed version of the spec referenced this RFC, but the Ecmarkup version doesn't. I'll be sure to add that reference back in."

These days there are JSON5 parsers for other platforms too.\r\n\r\nSo I don't think we'll be able to merge this, but your thoughts/questions/etc. welcome!"

        "body": "@aseemk Thanks for the quick feedback. I totally understand what you are wary of.\r\n\r\nActually, the reason why I put function as a value into JSON is not to execute the code (yes, I will have another engine to take care of that part), just extract the code as a string. With this way we exactly use JSON as a data exchange carrier. In fact, without function we could use string to pass the function, but not human friendly.\r\n\r\nFor JS runtime problem, I think JS (function as the first class citizen, ref: http://ryanchristiani.com/functions-as-first-class-citizens-in-javascript/) is a great language for learning and using for all kinds of work. Some platforms have their JS interpreter (https://github.com/robertkrimen/otto, for go language). Besides, since function is not a mandatory, any other platforms could ignore if they don't want to have.\r\n\r\nI am trying to combine the feature together with the best flavor of JSON I think so far. If it is not really fit for the initial design principle, I will have another repo to maintain the feature. And again I will continue to contribute something here once I have. :-)"

Ultimately we should move both forward in tandem using something like the following syntax:\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\n{\r\n  date: @d 05 October 2011 14:48 UTC, // quotes optional\r\n  map: @m {2:\"two\"}, // or nested array notation\r\n  object: @o {two, 2}, // or nested array notation\r\n  array: @a [1, 2, 'foo', 'foo'], // brackets optional\r\n  float32array: @f32a [21, 31],  // brackets optional\r\n  float64array: @f64a [21, 31],  // brackets optional\r\n  set: @s [1, 2,'foo'],  // brackets optional\r\n  regex: @r /match/i, // or string, but without flags\r\n  function: @f \"(arg1, arg2) {alert('hi'); //Kidding, don't do this.}\"\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nUltimately I am proposing the following:\r\n* `@<hint-string>` could be an optional way to disambiguate any literal past what the parser would consider the default for a given notation.\r\n* #91 might work better with a hint (see above).\r\n* The hint could be both a short code (`@f32a`) and long (`@float32array`) for clarity.\r\n* Parse errors for anything that does not match the <`hint-string`> object type.\r\n\r\nI chose `@` as it matches the Obj-C literal identifier, there may be better choices given the additional information we would want to convey. I can't think of other language conventions at this time."

        "body": "Exactly, that's the question: Is it about enhancing with ES5 features, or is it about making a format for humans (manual editing, readability, and clean diffs)?\r\n\r\nFor me, the solution was to create a format I call Config Object Notation (with .con as filename extension).  The concrete syntax is even more light weight than the proposal above, while still being trivial to tokenize and parse.  In case someone ends up reading this in search for a format that is more about being for humans than enhancing JSON with ES5 features, these are some of the key features of the format:\r\n\r\n- Abstract structure is based on JSON, but with some extensions.  Most notably, documentation comments are supported, see below.  Abstract structure is close enough to JSON to make one way conversion to JSON pretty straight-forward.\r\n- No separator is used between elements in arrays or between key/value pairs in objects.\r\n- The need to quote keys has been further reduced compared to JSON5, almost down to allowing any non-whitespace character in a non-quoted key.\r\n- By requiring the top value to be either an object or an array (which should be fine for any configuration file), the braces around a top level object may be omitted (the to level value must be an object unless the first token is an opening bracket).  Besides dropping the lines with the top level object delimiters, this makes it natural to start all top level key/value pairs in the first column.\r\n- Python style raw strings reduces amount of escape sequences when writing regular expressions.  By being distinct from normal strings in the abstract structure, a tool reading CON and writing back to file will be able to preserve them as raw strings.\r\n- So-called _single line_ comments may only be used to comment out an entire line, and are not part of the abstract structure (a tool reading CON and then writing back to file is not expected to preserve such comments).\r\n- So-called _multi-line_ comments are intended for documentation, and while this is still under development, the idea is that these should only be allowed in certain places, but be part of the abstract structure.  For example, a documentation comment is allowed following (separated only by horizontal space) any non-top value, and is attached to this value in the abstract structure.  Similarly, a documentation comment for the top level value is allowed at the beginning of the file.  Inside arrays, documentation comments may appear among the elements of the array (without being attached to any of the elements) if it is only surrounded by whitespace on the lines it occupies.  Inside objects, documentation comments may appear among the key/value pairs in a similar way.\r\n\r\nExample:\r\n```\r\n/* Small example of a Config Object Notation file.\r\n * (Documentation belonging to to level obejct.)\r\n */\r\nname: 'CON'\r\n/* Author details (documentation between key/value pairs) */\r\nauthor-name: 'Henrik'\r\nauthor-email: 'henrik@service' /* Not working, need to update. (Documentation belonging to value.) */\r\n/* Properties of the Config Object Notation format */\r\ntypes: [\r\n  /* Plain JSON types */\r\n  { name: 'Boolean' }\r\n  { name: 'Integer' }\r\n  {\r\n    name: 'Float'\r\n    examples: [ 4.2e1 Infinity -Infinity NaN ]\r\n  }\r\n  {\r\n    name: 'String'\r\n    examples: [\r\n      'Hello,'\r\n      \"world!\"\r\n    ]\r\n  }\r\n  /* Modified JSON types */\r\n  { name: 'Array' } /* May contain documentation comments among elements. */\r\n  { name: 'Object' } /* May contain documentation comments among elements. */\r\n  /* Extensions */\r\n  {\r\n    name: 'RawString'\r\n    examples: [ r'.*\\.con' ]\r\n  }\r\n]\r\n\r\n```"

So yes, this would allow creating functions and any other objects, but note: it is up to you what you would pass to `JSON5.parse(jsonString, env)`, in an environment argument. You also know the source of `jsonString`; if it is trustworthy or not.\r\n\r\nTo make it super clear what I think your proposal would sum up to:\r\n```js\r\nvar jsonString = \"{\" + \r\n\"  prop1: Function(\\\"a\\\", \"\\b\", \\\"return a + b;\\\")\" + \r\n\"}\";\r\n\r\nvar env = {\r\n  \"Function\": function() {\r\n     return Function.apply(null, arguments);\r\n  }\r\n};\r\n\r\nvar result = JSON5.parse(jsonString, env);\r\n\r\nassert(typeof result === \"function\");\r\nassert(result.prop1(1, 2) === 3);\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis is just as dangerous as the existing `reviver` can be...\r\nThe only difference is that there would be a special JSON syntax that would make the feature much more interesting. This syntax would make it much more probable that people would end up using common conventions for serialization of dates, etc. Right now, some use `{\"type\": \"Date\", value: \"2004-01-01\"}`, others use `{\"_\": \"Date\", v: \"2004-01-01\"}`, others use \"/Date(...)/\", etc.\r\n \r\nEven if you say that, generally, this is unsafe, there are applications where this is a required risk, like component/dashboard editors, where users do specify functions, and these need to  be serialized and deserialized."

        "body": "Thanks for the question. JSON5, jsonc, Hjson, and YAML all attempt to make JSON easier for humans to read and write. (Yes, YAML is a superset of JSON too.)\r\n\r\nI think the main thing that stands out with JSON5 is that, like JSON, it's just JavaScript. You can copy a JSON5 document into a JavaScript document, and you won't get syntax errors. (You can say the same thing about jsonc, but it doesn't make writing JSON that much easier.)\r\n\r\nHjson and YAML are easy to write, but they add a lot of syntax that is not compatible with JavaScript.\r\n\r\nHonestly, I think JSON5 should be the de facto standard for anything processed by humans, like configuration files. It just feels natural to write because it's just JavaScript. However, it's becoming more common to just `export` things from `.js` files, which would be fine except that different environments support different kinds of export syntax.\r\n\r\nBut as for machine processed data, like REST APIs, I think JSON is just fine. It's verbose, but its syntax is simple enough that it's easy to implement."

        "body": "Another good question. I can't speak for @aseemk, as he's the original creator, but for me, JSON5 indicates a specific, reliable target\u2014ES5. JSON5 syntax will never go beyond the syntax of ES5. Sure, that means it will miss out newer features, but it also means that users don't need to worry about what version of JSONX is supported.\r\n\r\nPersonally, I don't mind having a JSON5, JSON6, JSON7, as it makes it clear what features are supported, and they would always be backward compatible.\r\n\r\nAlternatively, we could use a `.jsonx` extension and have a version directive at the beginning of the file. Something like this maybe:\r\n\r\n```js\r\n/* JSON6 */\r\n{\r\n  template: `JSON6 supports a limited version of template strings.`,\r\n  unicode: `Plus code point escapes: \ud842\udfb7 === \\u{20BB7}`,\r\n  octal: 0o777,\r\n  binary: 0b10110010,\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe thing is, ES7, ES8, and ES9 haven't introduced any new JSON relevant syntax features. ES10 will have support for `BigInt` and the `n` number prefix, but there isn't really a specific need to implement that since there is technically no restriction on the length of numbers in JSON5. So JSON6 is the only new version of JSON that would have much value."

The big appeal of JSON5 is that it is a subset of the ECMAScript grammar that everyone's already familiar with\r\n- I would NOT want lots of **syntax sugar or redundant notations** for the same thing (as YAML does). It confuses people. It makes parser libraries larger.  It makes it difficult to rewrite a file while preserving its spacing and layout.\r\n- I would NOT want any **executable expressions** or \"macros\" in the file.  It's just a data file.

Maybe we should propose to merge **jsonc**, **jsonc-parser**, and **JSON5** into a single solution: It would use the **JSON5** feature set and library, but with the `.jsonc` file extension.  \"JSONC\" is a great name, because it nicely conveys the idea of \"JSON for Config files.\"  \r\n\r\nThe more I think about this, I love the concept of JSON5, but the name isn't very good because it implies that JSON5 is not a \"final\" solution to the problem.  We have *thousands* of config files spread across many teams and repos and products. If we migrate away from `.json`, it's going to be a very disruptive change. It will take work to persuade everyone.   The JSON5 name implies that `.json5` will inevitably evolve into a `.json6`. People can be persuaded to migrate once, but nobody's going to agree to a \"standard\" that is actually an endless treadmill of churning file formats, that break compatibility with older tools."

        "body": "> What are \"_Next_ gen features\"? Why weren't they part of JSON5 as originally proposed?\r\n\r\nAs of now, JSONext supports JSON5 syntax plus several ES6 syntax features. The [README](https://github.com/jordanbtucker/jsonext#current-features) gives examples. Some features weren't originally included in JSON5 because JSON5 targets ES5, not ES6. JSONext is meant to be an evolving version of JSON that adds new syntax features borrowed from the latest version of ES.\r\n\r\n> Your earlier assertion that _\"JSON5 syntax will never go beyond the syntax of ES5\"_ sounded really great. Representing simple strings/numbers in a text file is not a problem that requires a constantly evolving feature set.\r\n\r\nGlad to hear, because I don't see this ever changing for JSON5. My comments regarding JSON6, JSONX, and JSONext refer to other (potential) projects outside of JSON5.\r\n\r\n> * We ship these files to paying customers, so we need it to be a **\"standard\"** that can be widely supported across many different editors and syntax highlighters\r\n\r\nJSON5 has an [official specification](https://spec.json5.org/). It is not codified in an RFC, but neither is [YAML](https://yaml.org/spec/) or [Source Maps](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1U1RGAehQwRypUTovF1KRlpiOFze0b-_2gc6fAH0KY0k/edit#heading=h.djovrt4kdvga). It is used by popular libraries like [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) and [config](https://www.npmjs.com/package/config), among [others](https://www.npmjs.com/browse/depended/json5). However, it is lacking an active ecosystem of good platform implementations, syntax hilighters, and linters. If I didn't have a full time job, I would be able to devote more time to building those. Any help is appreciated!\r\n\r\n> The [\"jsonc\"](https://komkom.github.io/) project that I mentioned above is for Go programming language, apparently hasn't been touched in 2 years, and it seems like hardly anyone is using it. Maybe we should propose to merge **jsonc**, **jsonc-parser**, and **JSON5** into a single solution.\r\n\r\nI'm not opposed to this idea, but jsonc is already well established to mean *JSON with comments*, so changing jsonc to mean something else may present a challenge. BTW, the [sourcegraph](https://github.com/sourcegraph/sourcegraph/blob/master/pkg/jsonc/jsonc.go) implementation is the most popular jsonc parser for Go, as far as I know, and it's actively maintained.\r\n\r\n> The more I think about this, I love the concept of JSON5, but the name isn't very good because it implies that JSON5 is not a \"final\" solution to the problem.\r\n\r\nI don't think there really is a final solution. Software development changes very rapidly. New languages, tooling, IDEs, methodologies, and interfaces emerge every year. JSON5 is named so because it targets ES5, meaning it only borrows syntax from ES5, and it will always be compatible with ES5. As such, it is backward compatible with JSON and forward compatible with JavaScript.\r\n\r\nI do see where you're coming from regarding the name and file extension, though. I didn't choose it, and I personally would have gone with something less specific.\r\n\r\n> Nobody's going to agree to a \"standard\" that is actually an endless treadmill of churning file formats, that break compatibility with older tools.\r\n\r\nMaybe, but then you're locked into the situation we have now with JSON. It's an unchanging standard that won't break compatibility with older tools. Yet, we both came to this project looking for something better.\r\n\r\nTo sum things up. I'm not opposed to merging JSON5 into another JSON for Humans project, but I'd prefer that it is compatible with ECMAScript syntax and doesn't add any new data types over JSON. (No [`Date`](https://github.com/json5/json5/issues/3) or [`RegExp`](https://github.com/json5/json5/issues/91#issuecomment-197048166) support. I'm [not even happy](https://github.com/json5/json5-spec/issues/2) with JSON5 having `Infinity` and `NaN`.)"

Since both JSON and JSON5 allow for invalid code unit sequences, the CLI should preserve them, however this would be a breaking change. The best approach may be to add a CLI flag in v2.2 that escapes invalid code point sequences. In v3.0 we can make that behavior the default and replace the CLI flag with one that replaces invalid code unit sequences with `\\uFFFD`."

I plan on exposing a Lexer/Tokenizer class to help with tools that want more control over parsing JSON5, including the types of tools mentioned in your initial comment.\r\n\r\nIf we were to implement a `findByPointer` method, I think it would makes sense to put that on a Parser class.

And the implementation initially will be mostly a copy of this repo, and then after v3 is released, I can use the v3 parser instead of a copy of this one? So in the short term, there would be duplication but in the long term, it would be single-sourced, but the client api would stay the same regardless.\r\n\r\nIt seems like that would be a good way to address my short term needs and fit in with your long term plans."
