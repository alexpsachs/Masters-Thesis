Checkout its [Getting Started guide](http://bit.ly/jcuACj) and [examples](http://bit.ly/ljTkyr) (I hope bit.ly bundles won't annoy people).\n\nAlso, why don't Node client contributors drop by #rabbitmq? It's nice to see this library not being left to rot in the end. Get in touch with other AMQP client developers ;)\n"

Using a tight loop like `while(true)` in your code will keep node busy adding asynchronous tasks to the eventloop, but it also keeps it from actually performing any of them, because there is always something to do immediately - namely adding another task, and so on.\n\nYou'll find it works when you limit the loop iterations to - say 1000, or even better, actually respond to other events in an asynchronous way, and let these events trigger the publishing. This way there will always be enough waiting for other things to actually get around to send these messages.\n\nUnrelated, but your `if(e)` will never be true, because there is no e.\n"

A subscription (basic.consume in AMQP) is round-robin -- one of the consumers to the queue gets the message. The corresponding AMQP method is basic.cancel, not queue.unbind.\n\nThere's a couple of solutions that suggest themselves. One is to not cache queues -- create a new channel every time a queue is requested through connection.queue().  Closing (but not destroying) the queue would close the AMQP channel, and the subscription, and thereby have the correct effect.  By and large this would work, but in some cases it would give surprising results, because the detail of channels is hidden in node-amqp.\n\nThe second solution is to return a token from subscribe that can be used to unsubscribe. In AMQP, there is a \"consumer tag\" that is exactly suited to this purpose. There are some details to figure out, but I think this is probably the way to go. I will have a crack at it.\n"

Now I have to work with CoffeeScript and Node.js so I wanted to do the same work.\nBut, in fact, I need only to send instances' attributes so I have no more problem for my issue.\n\n---\n\nBut for information, the trick in ruby (with RabbitMQ) was only to make a serialization to a kind of string before passing the instance to the queue, and strip the serialization when the instance was received in order to get the full instance.\n\nI think maybe there is simplier method that could do it for us. Not necessarily a module, but I am not sure.\n\nWhen I started with ruby I read this in a book :\n\n\"When we publish a message to our queue using the publish\nmethod, the to_s method on that message is called to make sure that the message is\na String. The reason for this is because RabbitMQ is not a Ruby-based library;\nAMQP needs to be able to consistently send \u201csafe\u201d messages to it that will easily read\nwhen they come back again. String is definitely the easiest way to achieve that goal.\nSo how do we get around this problem? The answer is pretty simple and not\noverly complex. We need to serialize our HelloWorld instance to a String before we\ncall the publish method. Then, when we retrieve the message from the queue again,\nwe need to deserialize it and reconstitute our HelloWorld instance.\"\n\n(From : Addison Wesley Distributed Programming with Ruby Nov 2009-01) - Page 176\n\nThen, in the example of the book, it was possible to call the method say_hi() of the HelloWorld instance which displayed a \"Hello\" message.\n\n---\n\nSo maybe a simple string serialization could be efficient. Anyway my problem is solved because I don't really need to send methods. But in the book I read for Ruby, there were a way to send a method, but no good reason for doing it. So I don't know if it is really useful or not ^^\n\nThank you, your answer was useful for me.\n"

Would you advise me to do anything else?\n\nThanks :)\n"

Lesson learned from the Perl AMQP driver.\n\nAs for AMQP compatibility... I don't test on other platforms, but will certainly accept patches that increase interoperability.

        "body": "For most cases the no news is good news pattern works well, but there is an edge case where I am using it more for timing than confirmation. I have an RPC architecture with acknowledgement. So, system A sends a persistent message(1) to a group of worker systems. System B gets the job from the worker queue. B does the work and sends a reply message(2) to A on the RPC exchange. B then acknowledges message(1) on the worker queue. I want to wait until I am sure message(2) is at least buffered in the network interface (or is anywhere safe from the node process crashing) before I acknowledge message(1). In my scenario it is OK if an RPC call is processed twice and a reply sent twice, but it is not OK if the RPC never runs or runs and no reply ever sent. \n\nIn my environment, the rabbitmq servers are EXTREMELY dependable as are the OSes running them and the worker nodes. But, what is not dependable is the nodeJS processes themselves. This is mainly due to the fact that I am very familiar with AMQP setups and Linux setups for other web environments, like a LAMP stack, but I am relatively new to nodeJS. \n\nA stop gap I implemented since my initial post: I am satisfied calling a publish a success once the write stream for the connection has flushed to the kernel (write() returns true or `drain` event called on connection). so, i added som code to trigger success on promise when this flush occurs. I believe that once kernel has the data it will make it to rabbitmq if the only thing that happens is the nodeJS process dies.\n\nMaybe there is a better way, but given the raw AMQP protocol which has no publish-ok event, I think this is the closest thing that will work for my durability requirements. I have also considered doing a publish on the RPC message, then doing a settimeout on the ack of 10 minutes with the idea that publishing messages never takes longer than a minute so I am almost guaranteed to ack only after the RPC is received.\n"

The server won't send you another message until you acknowledge the last.\n\nThis is what is going on: AMQP has a setting called 'prefetch' that limits the number of unacknowledged messages a client is allowed to have at any one time; node-amqp sets this to 1 if you choose to use acknowledgements (i.e., use {ack: true} in the options when subscribing).\n"

        "body": "So, if you tell AMQP that you want to ack your messages, it won't send you more than prefetchCount pending messages before you have to ack. This library, prior to this pull request, supposes that prefetchCount == 1, which means that you only get one message, and won't get the next one until you ack it. That's what shift() does, it acks the last message you got. \n\nIf you want to increase prefetchCount to larger than 1 (or 0 for unlimited), you won't be able to use shift() anymore. This is because every time you get a message, its marked as the \"last message\", and shift will only ack the \"last message\". So suppose you are delivered ten messages m0, m1 ... m9 before you get a chance to ack any of them. Then you call shift() per each message, but that will send acks for m9 only since its marked as \"last message\". \n\nThat's why I added the message object as the last argument in the subscribe callback. You can acknowledge each messge object specifically using message.acknowledge() and without using shift() at all. Here's an example:\n\nvar q = connection.queue('MyQueue', {passive: true, autodelete: false}, function(queue) { \n    console.log(\"Queue \" + queue.name + \" is open\");\n    q.subscribe({ack: true,  prefetchCount: 10 }, function (json, headers, deliveryInfo, message) {\n        console.log(\"Received message : \" + json);\n        message.acknowledge();\n    });\n});\n\nThis will ack m0, m1, m2, etc...\n"

Say, for example, each consumer is piping messages through a stream, and only acknowledging them once the message has successfully written; if the stream is paused, the acknowledgment won't be made, and no other consumer will receive a message either, because they are all sharing the channel and thus the prefetch.\n> \n> One possible solution to this is to unhide channels, so to allow a channel per consumer. The API as is can be kept as a convenience, and channel exposed for when more fine-grained control is needed. Thoughts?

        "body": "Theo, \n\nI've started a branch `api_cleanup` which has a channel interface as well as keeping the connection.queue, connection.exchange etc. methods.\n\nThe main changes (mostly in https://github.com/squaremo/node-amqp/commit/6d9f27aabb87396586ca148aa031e4aa13c5bcf8) are:\n- queues and exchanges no longer inherit from Channel, but delegate to it;\n- Channel gets two methods for sending AMQP methods (one for when it should expect a reply, e.g., queue.bind, and one for when it shouldn't e.g., basic.publish), two special-purpose methods for registering and unregistering consumers, and one for publishing (which takes content as well as the method); everything else is then implemented using those\n- connection has a createChannel method, making Channel effectively public.\n\nI have also got rid of the events named for AMQP methods, which I always found a bit weird (e.g., subscribe is done when the 'basicQosOk' event fires?). The same effect can be had using the promise returned from the channel (and thereby the queue and exchange) methods.\n\nHere's an example of a test that I've rewritten:\nhttps://github.com/squaremo/node-amqp/blob/api_cleanup/test/test-simple.js\n\nAs you can see not much has changed, really just the means of synchronising on AMQP commands (now using the promise return value, as described above).\n"

        "body": "Some tests (and presumably application code) rely on events such as 'queueDeclareOk'; this is distinct from a callback, which receives the \"completed\" queue rather than the queueDeclareOk sent by the server (which has a message count).\n\nI can see three options:\n1. **Consistency**: queue() and exchange() return promises for the queueDeclareOk and exchangeDeclareOk objects sent back by the server, and take a callback which is given the 'completed' queue or exchange. This would preclude some race conditions that are currently easy to create, since the queue or exchange would not be available until it had been successfully declared.\n2. **Least change** (for present users): queue() and exchange() return 'incomplete' queues and exchanges as before, and e.g., queues emit 'queueDeclareOk' events as before.\n3. **For the sake of completeness**: queues and exchanges are returned as before, and are also promises, with addCallback() giving access to e.g., queueDeclareOk. Queues and exchanges don't emit these events.\n\nPersonally I favour consistency. One-off events should be represented in the API as callbacks (or promises) rather than events.\n"

I can't bind to q because q returns 0.  Nothing else.  If I setup my code as:\n\n``` javascript\nself.queue = self.connection.queue(self.opts.queuename, { durable:true, autoDelete: false }, function(q)\n{\n      // q = 0 so can't bind to it.\n     self.queue.bind(\"*\");  // works fine without a problem...???  why is the value in the callback = to 0?\n}\n```\n"

        "body": "Trying to figure out what on earth you're talking about since I never have seen 'addCallback' before, I looked into the history of node and found that between node 0.1.29 and 0.1.30 the explicit promise callback feature was removed, back in february of 2010.  Prior to that time there was an interface that looked like that, but I can find no documentation on anything that looks like that in the current api's.\n\nSo in a nutshell, YES, that's what I'm looking for but NO, I have no documentation that I can implement anything like that - nor given the code paths I understand out of the amqp module would anything like that work.  There would have to be an explicit listener to the basicConsumeOk that maps that particular acknowledgement back to the subscribe call that initiated it, and then activate the appropriate promise callback.  But there doesn't appear to be any information available to be used to map that information.  The amqp module does not have an obvious tight coupling between commands and their acknowledgement in general, though I may be missing something subtle in my reading of the code. \n\nI hypothesize by using alternative channels for the control of these operations, (issue one subscribe command on one channel and no more until a subscribe ack or nack has been received) tight coupling could be achieved.\n\nDue to the apparent loose coupling the fact that it works at all for the other three callbacks without confusion I chalk it up to an artifact of the patterns exhibited by the particular implementations of the protocol being utilized.\n\nThe fact is, I shouldn't have to assume as a library utilizer that the next event of a certain type is _MY_ consume acknowledgement - isn't it possible another execution context using this connection might have issued a subscribe on the control channel immediately after mine and before an acknowledgement for either is received?  Were that to happen with the current callback definitions for exchange declare and queue bind, I strongly suspect the callbacks would be triggered incorrectly.  (both might get called for both confirms, or one might get called and the other dropped, or both might get called for one confirm and the other confirm dropped)\n\nMaybe I'm wrong, and that's okay, I hope I am. But regardless of whether the module is working by design or accident, it currently works in my application setup.  \n\nThe subscribe signature should be consistent to the exchange declaration, connection ready, and queue binding and declaration interfaces, by providing a callback that ostensibly will be called when this particular command is acknowledged.\n"

        "body": "so I just spent about 15 minutes trying to figure out what this promise system even is.  Now, I think my original post probably seems rather confusing in the lack of my knowledge at the time that there exists a Promise module which was used in support of this module - but I used the term anyway.  Sorry about that.\n\nI like the promise module, it has interesting possibilities in code writing.\n\nSo we're facing two issues - one is, inconsistent API.  The other asynchronous calls for amqp commands have explicit callback parameters in their parameter lists.  Except for Subscribe which does not.  And the other calls, which per a light code study of at least the queue bind case, do not provide the promise api as an alternative.  Giving us a collection of things, one or more of which is not like the other.  Ick.\n\nThe other is that the subscribe call is not appropriately documented.  The entire explanation of subscribe, what it does and what it returns, doesn't discuss the promise interface or its availability at all.  The example doesn't use it, the text doesn't mention it.\n\nSurely you don't think the documentation of another api point (unsubscribe in this case) is appropriate documentation location for the subcribe api?  In this case, it was a page-or-so down the screen, but this is a long docs file.  I even reloaded the github page to see if you were pulling my chain and just changing the subscribe docs while I wasn't looking then pretending it was there all along.\n\nSo the easiest one is to repair the documentation so that the available api of subscribe is fully documented in its _own_ documentation block... which would have prevented the entire amount of exploration and troubleshooting I've done to figure out why that's not the case.  I can submit a pull request for that I suspect.\n\nIt would add internal consistency to the library to modify the subscribe implementation with an optional final callback parameter which is merely conditionally added as a promise callback when supplied. I could probably put that in a pull too, as its fairly simple.\n\nThe ultimate in consistency would be to do both the first and second, AND modify the other api's to use the promise API for their callbacks too, revising the documentation to reflect their availability, making it consistently flexible in all cases.  But that's a pretty deep refactoring of this code... \n"

But conventions are confusing in this regard.\n\nIn general AMQP clients, and specifically the Node.JS client, expect a vhost in the path part of the connection URL. This is either empty (nothing after the host), meaning the \"default vhost\"; or, it starts with a slash -- however the slash is _not_ counted as part of the vhost name, which means that any leading slash in the name has to be included in addition to the slash beginning the path. For example, if I have a vhost '/foo' then the URL should be something like 'amqp://host:port//foo'.\n\nAnother source of confusion is that RabbitMQ uses '/' as the default (as in pre-installed) vhost, prompting the convention of prefixing a slash.\n\nAffixing a slash removes the possibility of addressing vhosts without it.\n"

        "body": "Hi panosru,\n\nI'm not postwait, but maybe I can help :)\n\n1) `connection.publish` publishes to the default exchange (normally the nameless one you see in the management plugin), but this can be configured. The first parameter you provide here is the routing key, which is equal the queue name when using the default exchange.\n\n`exchange.publish` is more explicit and makes it possible to provide a routing key on an explicit exchange.\n\n2) I don't exactly understand.  What do you mean by commit?\n\n3) I don't understand this neither. Afaik there is no concept of a rollback in AMQP. Consumers can request an acknowledgement mode when subscribing to a queue. This has the effect that on connection loss, any unacknowledged message gets requeued. Can you detail you question a bit more?\n\n4) Subscribe to a queue and provide a message handler. The message handler will be invoked for every message deliverey to the consumer. This propably differs from php-amqplib, since node.js is aync by design.\n\n5) You can't. You can only subscribe and republish the messages, but this destroys the order of messages in the queue. If you are only interested in the length of a queue, you have several options:\n- the management plugin provides a status api\n- call `connection.queue` with the `passive:true` option to read the state of the queue.\n"

By rollback I mean, in case of transaction failuter to \"rollback\" to previous state before the start of transaction but since @postwait confirmed that transaction support is not yet implemented so is not possible to rollback. [PHP AMQPChannel](http://php.net/manual/en/class.amqpchannel.php) [RabbitMQ Broker Semantics](http://www.rabbitmq.com/semantics.html) :) \n\n4) Would you mind to provide a simple example in order to get the point? Messages in PHP also work async, of course PHP itself is not async by design.\n\n5) If you don't set auto delete for messages and for any reason you need to know not only how many messages are in the queue but you need to iterate through them is not possible? Would be great if you could have an array of objects where each object would be a message object.\n\nOne more question I forgot to ask, is it possible to get a message from queue? For instance:\n\n``` js\nvar amqp = require('amqp');\n\nvar connection = amqp.createConnection({ host: 'dev.rabbitmq.com' });\n\n// Wait for connection to become established.\nconnection.on('ready', function () {\n  // Use the default 'amq.topic' exchange\n  connection.queue('my-queue', function(q){\n      // Get message by message id (Sync)\n      var message = q.get('message-id-here');\n\n      // Get message by message id (Async)\n      q.get('message-id-here', function (err, message) {\n           if (err) { \n               // Handle error in case message does not exist \n            } else {\n              // Do anything with message\n           }\n      });\n  });\n});\n```\n\n@postwait Thanks for clarifying that transactions are not yet supported, are there any plans to support them?\n\nThanks a lot to everyone :)\n"

When I connect, it connects to the first one on port 5672. But if I shut that one down in the cluster, I get `Error: Error: connect ECONNREFUSED`.\n\nHow should this work? Thanks!\n\n**Edit**\n\nLooking at the code, it appears as though the only option that is expected to be an Array is the _host_ option. However, how does this work if the host is the same, but the port is different (running a cluster on your own computer)? What would be best is if the library took in the \"url\" option as an Array, so all the options can be specified unique to each computer.\n"

I was wondering if there could be more movement to finish this up, and merge in the last year's changes to node-amqp.\n\nWe have a thousands of queues (which AFAIK is a normal use case), and having a channel per queue results in hundreds of MB of extra overhead for the server. Here's a reference RabbitMQ thread about this: http://lists.rabbitmq.com/pipermail/rabbitmq-discuss/2013-April/026486.html . In addition, setting a prefetchCount that spans multiple subscriptions becomes impossible. \n\nThanks again!\n"

        "body": "One problem with throwing is, you never ever want to throw in a node application, unless you can actually catch the error.  Asynchronous control flow makes knowing when you can catch the error unintuitive, because you can only actually catch an error that was thrown in the same call stack.  And knowing exactly where the call stacks begin and end requires a great deal of cognitive overhead.  Also, wrapping everything with try-catch blocks is slow, bad style and anti-pattern\u2014and the library can't do that for you because there's no way to know about anything ansynchronous in your handler.  So it's much, much better in node to emit error events than to throw errors.  Error handling in this library still leaves something to be desired, but you should have better luck by using `#emit` rather than `throw`\n"

        "body": "Well one step further, but now the reconnect code fails on me because I use temporary queues (name generated by the broker) and the reconnect code tries to re-declare them with the broker using the assigned names. This is not allowed by the broker (the prefix is not allowed). So as an alternative I tried to disable the reconnect (using {reconnect: false} in the createConnection call) but that gives me a whole new problem because I now get 2 'error' events with this message: {\"code\":\"Unknown system errno 37\",\"errno\":\"Unknown system errno 37\",\"syscall\":\"connect\"}. Then I reenabled the reconnect and saw that when reconnect is set to true I also get this error but only once, after that I get the 'ready' event. Does anyone have any suggestion how to properly handle the broker disconnects?\n"

        "body": "Hi all, I'm having some issues with connecting to a RabbitMQ server via SSL.  At first, since I don't control the rabbit server, I was attempting to not use any certs.  After not being able to connect, I contacted the admin and requested any log entries he might have.  I was returned the following:\n\n=INFO REPORT==== 1-Jul-2013::11:17:52 ===\naccepting AMQP connection <0.25461.2> (192.168.2.241:48428 -> 192.168.2.210:5671)\n\n=ERROR REPORT==== 1-Jul-2013::11:17:53 ===\nerror on AMQP connection <0.25445.2>: {ssl_upgrade_error,\"record overflow\"} (unknown POSIX error)\n\nTo help troubleshoot, the admin turned on the non-SSL port, and I was able to connect no problem.  I have wrote a python script to see if I could connect via SSL that way, and it worked as well.  So, I'm certain that the Rabbit server is configured correctly and prepared to accept an SSL connection.\n\nAt this point, I requested the SSL certs, and got a .crt file, which is in .pem format.  Below you can see the connection string I'm using.  All connection variables are passed into the method via an array.  \n\nconn =  AMQP.createConnection(\n                        {\n                            host:       conn_info['host'],\n                            port:       conn_info['host_port'],\n                            login:      conn_info['user'],\n                            password:   conn_info['pass'],\n                            vhost:      conn_info['virt_host'],\n                            ssl:        { \n                                          enabled: conn_info['ssl_opts']['enabled'],\n                                          caFile : '../../certs/ca.crt',\n                                          rejectUnauthorized: conn_info['ssl_opts']['rej_unauth']\n                                        }\n                        },\n                        {\n                            defaultExchangeName: conn_info['default_exch']\n                        }\n                    );\n\nSo, I'm positive at this point, the fault lies with me.

The little research I've done suggests that EADDRNOTAVAIL means you're trying to bind a socket that's already bound. But connecting from a client-side app shouldn't have to do that, right?\n\nMaybe it has to do with keeping the old connection around?\n\nSide question: Is there a way to turn off the reconnect logic from client code? When RabbitMQ dies, I have to rebuild the world on the client side anyway (reestablish transient exchanges, make a new queue etc.) So I'd kinda like to just do the reconnecting myself.\n"

It is comforting to know other people have run into the same problem ;) I read somewhere that there is a frame_max setting in config file that can be set to 0 for unlimited size. I don't know that would solve the issue or not. Currently I am using cloudAMQP on Heroku with my node.js server. I contacted support and they told me that only if I had the $499/mo. package they would change the config file for me. Makes sense, with packages with different limitations they cannot allow the user to change any configuration.\n\u00a0\u00a0\nRegards\nMatloob ul Hasan\n\n> ---\n> \n> From: Patrick de Lanauze notifications@github.com\n> To: postwait/node-amqp node-amqp@noreply.github.com \n> Cc: Matloob ul Hasan matloobh@yahoo.com \n> Sent: Friday, July 19, 2013 1:25 AM\n> Subject: Re: [node-amqp] How to send data larger than frame size?

According to the AMQP spec, the client should send the [connection close](http://www.rabbitmq.com/amqp-0-9-1-reference.html#connection.close) method to the server whenever closing a connection.  The amqp-node library just closes the socket (without sending any notice to the server).\n\nI have a patch ready, but there is one thing I would like some feedback about.  According to AMQP spec, the server responds with a [close-ok](http://www.rabbitmq.com/amqp-0-9-1-reference.html#connection.close-ok).  This \"tells the recipient that it is safe to release resources for the connection and close the socket.\"  So... should I wait for the \"close-ok\" before closing the socket?  Should I put in a fallback in case we never receive the \"close-ok\" (maybe a timeout of some sort)?\n"

The problem seems to be that the current implementation is sending `.write()`s to the underlying TCP socket without checking whether the socket is ready to receive more data. This causes the socket to start buffering data in memory, and that buffer can balloon very quickly. \n\nThe following pull request exposes an `isBackedUp` property on the `Connection` that lets you check whether its safe to keep sending data without growing the in-memory buffer: https://github.com/postwait/node-amqp/pull/253\n\nBasically if `queue.connection.isBackedUp` is true, you (the node-amqp user) have to stop sending messages and either discard them or buffer them in some safe, manageable way.\n\nThe pull request also adds the ability to specify a max memory buffer size (e.g. `amqp.createConnection({..., maxWriteBuffer: 1e6})` for a 1 MB buffer). \n\nNot sure if this is the best way to deal with this problem, but it does seem to resolve the memory growth issues I've been seeing.\n"

I do like that your pull request allows previous functionality to remain exactly the same though.\n\nIn my testing I discovered that it _is_ important to ignore any received messages (except connectionClose and connectionCloseOk) after you've sent the connection close message, otherwise some errors can occur.  So, it's not just a matter of following the spec, but does actually affect real behavior and stability.  You can see my pull request for an example of how I chose to do this.\n\nAlso-- a word of advice-- the maintainers of this library are unlikely to merge your request if it does not contain any unit tests, so you can improve your chances by adding tests as well.  That said, they haven't accepted my pull requests either, so who am I to be giving advice? ;-)\n"

        "body": "I am getting the same error, however, it's limited to only the servers in my prod environment. My local environment, dev, and stage all work fine. However, it's 100% reproducible on the prod servers. The interesting thing is that they all have the same server setup (except my local env).\n\nI have tried using the latest stable version of the node-amqp library (that does not include the explicit `connectionCloseOk` handler), as well as with the `connectionCloseOk` handler and both have the same issue.\n\nAfter using node-inspector to step through the entire execution flow (very, very tediously) I still could not figure out exactly why it was throwing the ECONNRESET error. The `connectionClose` event to the rabbit server gets sent fine, and I get the `connectionCloseOk` response from the server. However, once it calls `socket.end()` after that it always throw this exception.\n\nIf I use netstat to see how many sockets are open to the rabbit server I can see that the socket has not been closed, so eventually rabbit starts blocking the connections as my node-pool continues to create new connections (thinking the old ones were closed properly).\n\nI've been able to fix the ECONNRESET error by modifying the call to `socket.end()` to be `socket.destroy()` instead after it receives the `connectionCloseOk` response. With that change I no longer get the ECONNRESET error, and the socket is properly closed. However, I'm not sure if that's the proper way to close the socket, or if there may be other unintended consequences that arise from that change, but so far I haven't noticed any ill effects and it's been running in my prod environment for the past few weeks.\n\nHere is some information on the environment where this issue happens:\n\n**OS:** Debian Squeeze (v6.0.8)\n**Node:** v0.10.5\n**RabbitMQ:** v3.1.5\n**node-amqp:** v0.1.8\n"

I did the same thing...I used a branch with the `connectionCloseOk` handler, changed `socket.end()` to `socket.destroy()` and everything started working properly: there was no longer an exception, the socket did not show up when using `netstat -an | grep 5672`, and the RabbitMQ admin console showed that the connection was no longer open.\n\nI'm not sure why it wouldn't work for you, but I'd chalk it up to the weirdness of this bug in general. It seems to vary under what circumstances it happens, and it seems that it varies under which conditions it's \"fixed\" as well. For now, it's working for me and that's the most important thing. I'm still hoping for an actual fix for it though. I just wanted to present my findings as far as what worked for me in case it can help anyone else in the short term.\n"

Make sure your app stops trying to send data after a close\n2. Extend the branch to make node-amqp throw a more obvious error in this scenario\n3. Call socket.end() _and_ socket.destroy() in the handler - this should stop data being sent after the close think.\n"

Anything that gets held onto by _stream_writeable.js due to\n        // back-pressure will be handed to tcp_wrap (net.js) in a new tick and therefore this corruption\n        // will take effect\n        b[1] = 255;\n\n        client.end();\n        server.close();\n    });\n});\n```\n\nThis reproduces it with less than 1Mb of data going out a socket on my Macbook. In low-I/O situations, the buffer gets sent to tcp_wrap and the buffer gets copied. But when the OS buffer is full, `_stream_writable.js` starts [holding onto the buffers by reference](https://github.com/joyent/node/blob/v0.10.17/lib/_stream_writable.js#L207) which makes them susceptible to overwrites in the shared buffer.\n"

I did some tracing, and there is no packet sent to RabbitMQ after amqp's Close. RST may be intentional, i.e. RabbitMQ does not wish to do full for way close, but cuts the connection short with RST. If that is the case, then probably something should handle and quiet ECONNRESET after closeOk is received.\n"

        "body": "I strongly believe that the previous default was a bug; L452 of connection.js should have read `this.options.heartbeat || 580`, as the rabbitMQ default is `580` and it needs to be explicitly set to something else in order to disable it. I think this is very confusing to users that expect the defaults to be respected, especially since the example `option` hashes do not include a `heartbeat` attribute.\n\nPlease consider changing this in the next major release, and in the meantime documenting it as `heartbeat: 0 // by default, heartbeats are disabled, see below` in the example connection hashes to explain what is happening. Heartbeats are a fundamental feature of rabbitMQ and it is nonsensical to have them disabled by default - and we are going to leave it that way, it needs to be extremely explicit or we risk a great deal of hard-to-find bugs.\n"

        "body": "This happens because the ready events and optional ready callback are executed in the same stack as the parser's onMethod. The parser is wrapped by a try/catch block, catching any exceptions from this stack, including the user's event listeners and readyCallback.\n\nIf you want to let your program crash, a workaround for now would be to disable `reconnect` in the options, and avoid listening on any `'error'` events. Of course the downside is that since errors between module and user functions are not distinguished, you would lose all graceful error control.\n\nTo address the actual issue, we need to differentiate between an exception originating from a user function vs exceptions from the parser. We could invoke the user functions inside their own try/catch and ideally bind them to `process.domain` if existent. If not, we could re-throw the exception.\n"

The failures we see are numerous (network fails) and no library we've used handles them all.\n\nInitially I thought this was the responsibility of the library but in hindsight realise the developer needs to be fully aware of why a failure might occur.\n\nWe use your library and don't bother with failures, just let the process die and restart with forever. The microseconds of downtime don't have any affect on us.\n\nHowever, within the ruby-amqp library we also use, we do use the built-in recovery feature but have had to wrap some extra error handling to make it work (primarily in the event RabbitMQ is down when it restarts).\n\nWith node-amqp, even though there was auto-recovery, it didn't work for us. We ended up altering things slightly as per #345 \n\nWith your library, the promise based architecture was a challenge for us but overall, we've had far more success and our random connection drops (and therefore missing data) have vanished completely. The port was worth it :)\n"

I should note that my messages are fairly short JSON objects themselves. Looking at the details of the heap dump, the worst heap growth offenders (>1mb) are:\n\n``` json\n\"details\": [\n  {\n      \"+\": 213898,\n      \"-\": 7889,\n      \"size\": \"7.4 mb\",\n      \"size_bytes\": 7762888,\n      \"what\": \"Array\"\n  },\n  {\n      \"+\": 154195,\n      \"-\": 7,\n      \"size\": \"7.06 mb\",\n      \"size_bytes\": 7401024,\n      \"what\": \"Buffer\"\n  },\n  {\n      \"+\": 154231,\n      \"-\": 65,\n      \"size\": \"10.59 mb\",\n      \"size_bytes\": 11099952,\n      \"what\": \"Closure\"\n  },\n  {\n      \"+\": 3509,\n      \"-\": 0,\n      \"size\": \"27.48 mb\",\n      \"size_bytes\": 28811264,\n      \"what\": \"Native\"\n  },\n  {\n      \"+\": 154191,\n      \"-\": 1,\n      \"size\": \"7.06 mb\",\n      \"size_bytes\": 7401056,\n      \"what\": \"WriteReq\"\n  },\n]\n```\n\nI've even tried narrowing down and simplifying the `publish` code myself, with a forced garbage collection at the end of every `publish`, no callbacks, no tasks, and still no difference in heap growth:\n\n``` javascript\n  publishToExchange: function (routingKey, data, theOptions, callback) {\n    var exchange = module.exports.rabbitMQExchange;\n    var options = _.extend({}, theOptions || {});\n\n    options.routingKey = routingKey;\n    options.exchange   = exchange.name;\n    options.mandatory  = options.mandatory ? true : false;\n    options.immediate  = options.immediate ? true : false;\n    options.reserved1  = 0;\n\n    var methods = require('./borrowed/amqp-definitions').methods;\n\n    exchange.connection._sendMethod(exchange.channel, methods.basicPublish, options);\n    exchange.connection._sendBody(exchange.channel, data, options);\n    new memwatch.gc(); // force a GC!\n  },\n```\n"

        "body": "So - at least on my end I can absolve `node-amqp` partially. Our rabbit server was on its knees, and barely responding (due to other queuing issues). What seems to be the case is that my `publish` closures  (native code + small bits of data) were potentially quickly accumulating on the stack. Hard to replicate now with our flailing server bounced. Regardless, my calls to `publish` were somehow either failing silently or lacking mechanism to eventually fail and be cleaned up by the GC. I'll bow out of this thread for now; in the process we switched to `amqplib/amqp.node`. As you can see above, I referenced other libraries tested such as `amqp-coffee`, both of those threw SSL/TLS errors trying to connect to our rabbit server (which has a self-signed cert; node-amqp does not complain about connecting with a self-signed cert while those other two libraries do). So that's an unrelated issue but another to pop off to an alternative library.\n"

If a socket is persistent, it will declare queues as durable, and send messages with deliveryMode of 2. The exceptions are SUB sockets, which don't declare their subscription queue as durable, although PUB sockets are allowed to publish persistent (deliveryMode=2) messages; and REQ sockets, which do declare the request queue (that they send to) as durable, but not their own reply queue.\n"

I've been testing by adding an iptables rule on the HAProxy server, dropping packets from HAProxy to a specific cluster member that the client is connected to. After 2 \\* heartbeat, the client would sometimes reconnect and sometimes not. By adding this option, (and setting it to true) the error is always thrown and the client reconnects to HAProxy, which in turn directs the TCP request at a host that it can reach.\n\nDoes that make sense? I wasn't sure how else to create a test scenario for it\n"

After a little digging through the code it seems there is a rather strict data type check when serializing the header. All fields are checked against definitions located in \"amqp-definitions-0-9-1.js\".\n\nIn my case the \"expiration\" field is marked as \"shorstr\", which seems like a type-o. I've sent a pull request with the correction #426.\n\nNow, on the issued raised by @JunejaTung:\n\n> Sometimes exchange.publish got confused error. I can sure that routingKey is a string.\n\nit makes sense that an apparent \"random\" error occurs when type checking, but most likely in some cases the value just exceeds the length of 255 characters. Look at the validation in \" serializer.js\"\n\n> if (typeof(param) != \"string\" || param.length > 0xFF) {\n>      throw new Error(\"Unmatched field \" + JSON.stringify(field));\n> }\n"

        "body": "@postwait thanks for the reply. \r\n\r\nAs you suggested, I modified the code so it does not create the exchange each time.  And this resolved the  initial memory leak warning from node. I kept track of the listeners on the connection object and, when RMQ is running constantly, the listener count remains the same.\r\n\r\nHowever, if the RMQ server is bounced, it looks like the listener count begins to creep upwards, albeit at a slower rate.\r\n\r\nThe code I ran and resulting output is below. \r\n\r\n```\r\nconst EventEmitter = require('events'),\r\n      amqp = require('amqp');\r\n\r\nlet e = new EventEmitter();\r\n\r\nlet connectionOptions = {\r\n    url: 'amqp://guest:guest@127.0.0.1:5672'\r\n};\r\n\r\nlet options = {\r\n    reconnect: true,\r\n    reconnectBackoffStrategy: 'linear',\r\n    reconnectExponentialLimit: 2000,\r\n    reconnectBackoffTime: 1000\r\n};\r\n\r\nlet publishTimer = undefined;\r\n\r\nlet connection = amqp.createConnection(connectionOptions, options);\r\n\r\nconnection.on('error', (err) => {\r\n    console.error('Error connecting to AMQP broker (%s)', connectionOptions.url, err.message);\r\n});\r\n\r\nconnection.on('close', () => {\r\n    console.error('Connection to AMQP broker (%s) closed', connectionOptions.url);\r\n\r\n    // Stop publishing\r\n    if(publishTimer) clearInterval(publishTimer);\r\n\r\n    // Disconnect the connection. I found that if I didn't do this,\r\n    // the connection would not automatically reconect.\r\n    connection.disconnect();\r\n});\r\n\r\nconnection.on('connect', () => {\r\n    console.info('Connection made', connectionOptions.url);\r\n});\r\n\r\nconnection.on('ready', () => {\r\n    console.info('Publisher connection made to AMQP', connectionOptions.url);\r\n\r\n    e.emit('connected');\r\n});\r\n\r\n// Open the exechange\r\ne.on('connected', () => {\r\n    console.dir('got connected');\r\n\r\n    connection.exchange('', {confirm: true}, (exchange) => {\r\n        e.emit('opened', exchange);\r\n    });\r\n});\r\n\r\n// Once the exchange is opened, start interval to publish continously.\r\ne.on('opened', (exchange) => {\r\n    publishTimer = setInterval(() => {\r\n        console.dir('Number of error listeners: ' + connection.listeners('error').length);\r\n\r\n        exchange.publish('telemetry', {abc: 123}, {}, (err) => {\r\n            if(err) {\r\n                console.error('Unable to publish message to queue', 'telemetry', err.message);\r\n                console.dir(err);\r\n            } else {\r\n                console.log('Published!');\r\n            }\r\n        });\r\n    }, 2000);\r\n});\r\n\r\n// Interval to keep process running\r\nsetInterval(() => {\r\n    console.log('Heartbeat');\r\n}, 60000);\r\n```\r\n\r\nAnd here's the output. The comments (indicated by -->) in the file I added to help explain what was going on.\r\n```\r\nConnection made amqp://guest:guest@127.0.0.1:5672\r\nPublisher connection made to AMQP amqp://guest:guest@127.0.0.1:5672\r\n'got connected'\r\n'got opened'\r\n'Number of error listeners: 3'\r\nPublished!\r\n'Number of error listeners: 3'\r\nPublished!\r\n--> THE PREVIOUS 2 LINES REPEAT UNTIL RMQ IS STOPPED.

Use emitter.setMaxListeners() to increase limit.```.\r\n\r\nAm I improperly handling connections/exchanges or is there a lower level bug in the reconnection logic as it pertains to handling event listeners?\r\n\r\nThanks.\r\n\r\n"

The metadata and message body are returned without modifications so that the application can store the message for later redelivery.\r\n\r\nin [`exchange.js:179`](https://github.com/postwait/node-amqp/blob/1d30ce178d4a1781f2199f136e4e942e725cfa4c/lib/exchange.js#L179) the message should be retrieved just like in the `basicAck` branch above and passed on to the callback IMO.\r\n~~I'm probably going to write a PR for this now.~~\r\n**EDIT:** dropped the meteor package wrapping this lib and switched over to [amqp.node](https://github.com/squaremo/amqp.node) which we are using in another codebase already."

On receiving the event, it first tries to call `this.socket.end()` function which is throwing the and possible reason for that is socket is no more available to communicate with server. \r\n\r\nThe fix is comment out or remove `this.socket.end()` and `this.socket.destroy()` will automatically destroys the socket, which is what a client intends when it calls a disconnect function. Finally, it would look like this\r\n\r\n`case methods.connectionCloseOk:`\r\n`debug && debug(\"Received close-ok from server, closing socket\");`   \r\n`this.socket.destroy();`\r\n`break;`\r\n\r\nAs I am beginner, correct me if something is wrong with this,"
