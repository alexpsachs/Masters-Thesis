Adds a `/clear` command which resets the screen (useful if you want to keep track of what you have read or not)\n2. Rather than only sending the last 10 lines of history when you log in, it will detect the height of your terminal and send that amount of previously received messages (up to 80 lines)\n3. Gives you one of the following messages whenever you log in (depending on how many other users are in the room):\n   - \"You are all alone in here.\"\n   - \"At least you have **shazow** to keep you company.\"\n   - \"There are currently 12 users chatting.\"\n\n> We just added reading MOTD from a file, which lets you write longer intros. Does this improve anything over that?\n\nIt should actually work well with those changes. The code that uses the MOTD in this pull request just measures how many lines long the message is, then it subtracts that amount from the amount of history to display (since that information will be off-screen anyway).\n"

I have experience from other SQL providers, so obviously I'm quick to choose sqlite.\n\nHowever my inner developer says we need to create interfaces and adapters for pluggable storage systems.\n\nSo how about an interface \"storage\" which relies on an adapters directory for storage systems that can be picked from?\n\nThis also naturally leads to a configuration file, which I believe should be simple and uncomplex. Maybe XML (though that seems overly complex for the job, but simple enough so that it can be read/understood by anybody) or standard ini style parsing.\n\nThe config file \"system\" should have some type of RFS, for example, if we choose XML, we need to discuss how the sections will lay out in the file. If we choose an INI based mechanism, we need to understand how the ini file sections will lay out.\n\nSo, I would say a pre-req to this ticket, is the creation of some type of configuration file and parser before this can be implemented.\n"

However, I've been having trouble authenticating (and the go documentation hasn't been very useful). What type of authentication does the server use? Based on the code it looks like `PublicKey` or `KeyboardInteractive`, but I haven't had much success with using either.\n\nUnfortunately most example code I've found online is for password authentication, which the server doesn't use.\n"

I needed git to go get ssh chat, and that required xcode one way or another, although `brew install git` made it easy. a .pkg would not require xcode because it is already built. then rookie users like me (especially those with old macs and that have to sign up for a developer id to get access to old xocde versions, also me) can install with ease. And homebrew makes this easy. Now, if I didn't have go installed, `brew install ssh-chat` would have installed go as a dependency. This streamlines everything, and if I make an addon for ssh-chat, I can manage that easily.\n"

I think this is consistent with Go's decision to exclude http(s)://, git:// etc from the import statements, and adding ipfs:// or similar would be a regression in that direction.\n\nThis is a misunderstanding. `/ipfs` is there because it allows mounting the whole filesystem and accessing packages that way. Think of it like the service provider, \"github.com\" part. `gx` itself uses _either_ ipfs OR http to pull down the content into that directory.\n\nBTW: the scheme identifier is evil and separated the Web from the Filesystem, which is a problem we're fixing by correctly labeling transports, AND self-describing.\n\n> 1. I don't want to require an additional non-ubiquitous service that is largely unrelated to golang dev just to build the project. If it was an optional enhancement, that'd be cool.\n\n`gx` works out of the box without ipfs, it uses http from the ipfs.io gateway. (think of it as our github.com or our npm), but it verifies all the content is correct, and version locks.\n\ntry it out.\n\nalso the import rewriting will disappear once we add hash mapping in the `package.json` `name: hash` (like the `name: version` mapping in npm package.json) \n\n> Really a pinning/lock file is probably the way to go, where aware tools can fetch the dependencies from the best possible source but still fall back to the normal golang vendoring/namespacing mechanics.\n\nyeah do whatever is best for your project. it's still early days of gx.\n"

I'm going to keep hacking on stuff on and off until then. Will ping this thread for the next hackathon. :heart:\n"

The benefit of registration is you get offline presence (aka you appear as in-chat even if you disconnect) and you get instant email notifications of mentions and emails of conversation summaries of what you missed (hourly/daily maybe). Possibly do push notifications too (through pushbullet or something else).\n"

        "body": "> I think it's okay to leave some non-essential commands hidden. :)\n\nHow do you determine if a command is essential or not? Doesn't it depend on the user and the context? If the user wants to find out the version of the chat, then `/version` is essential. If they want to rename themselves, then `/nick` is essential. If they don't want to change their nick, then `/nick` is useless to them.\n\nFrom a UX perspective, as a user, I feel cheated when there's what appears to be an exhaustive list of commands, but in reality it turns out that it was an incomplete list.\n\nIt encourages guessing and feeling unconfident. A real example of what I ran into was that I wanted to find out the version, and when I saw that `/help` didn't list `/version`, I figured it must be impossible. Then I tried `/version` just in case, and was frustrated to find out that `/help` lied to me. So next time I see a list of commands, I won't have the confidence in knowing if there's other unlisted commands or not, which leads to a poorer user experience.\n\nI'd be happier if there was a sentence at the end saying \"There are additional hidden commands, see full list in source.\" or \"Additional minor commands are hidden.\", if you don't want to actually list all commands.\n\nJust wanted to share some feedback. :) ssh-chat is awesome!\n"

Software has had hidden commands and features since software has become a thing. That's not to make you feel cheated, but more to allow for advanced usecases without shoving every possible scenario down the throats of beginners. :)\n\nAs I said before, if you feel super strongly about this then please make a PR to satisfy your use case. The extra commands can be included in a manual page. Or maybe a `/help commands` which just exhaustively lists all registered commands without the extra info would be a good compromise? Anyways, all up to how strongly you feel about this.\n"

        "body": "The error stems from [host.go#L310](https://github.com/shazow/ssh-chat/blob/398cd75c5e9a2ca27e61b25d45c91962d1ccd040/host.go#L310) because it's getting an error when looking for a user to reply back to. Which I'm guessing implies we never set a user to reply to when a `/msg` command is sent to the server.\n\nI just did a search against the code; do we ever use `setReplyTo()` anywhere? The only instance I could find [is where we define setReplyTo() in the code](https://github.com/shazow/ssh-chat/search?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=setReplyTo). Maybe it's a matter of `/msg` doesn't use `setReplyTo()`?\n"

If you want a user that can only write to another user, that's too narrow of a use case and out of scope for this project. I suggest forking for that.\r\n\r\n> How to set passwords? After logging in with a nickname, requesting a password.\r\n\r\nYou can [whitelist users using public keys](https://github.com/shazow/ssh-chat/wiki/FAQ#can-i-block-users-from-connecting-how-do-i-assign-admins), passwords are less safe and considered out of scope for this project.\r\n\r\n> Also perhaps, someday support for RSA ssh keys generated by using -o?\r\n\r\nHmm where is it not supported?

It's not certain that the v2 refactor will get merged anytime soon\u2014I'm experimenting with some big changes which might not pan out.\r\n\r\nIf you're looking for things to hack on, I suggest checking the [Tiny](https://github.com/shazow/ssh-chat/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3ATiny) tag which should be just a few lines of changes and a great place to start. For bigger work, [Help Wanted](https://github.com/shazow/ssh-chat/labels/Help%20Wanted) is a good one."

        "body": "The reason CI fails is because some of the vendored dependencies are not compatible with `gofmt -s` (luckily, they are compatible with plain `gofmt`).\r\n\r\nI've discussed the options for a resolution with @shazow, which are:\r\n\r\n1. See if a newer version already fixes it, update to it if so.\r\n2. Otherwise, try to send a PR upstream to fix it myself, and if/once it's merged, update the vendored copy.\r\n3. Find a way to ignore `/vendor/` from `gofmt -s` check.\r\n\r\nHe told me he prefers option 3, and it's consistent with some of the CI checks already skipping /vendor/.\r\n\r\nI've never had to skip `/vendor/` from `gofmt` checks in my experience, because I use a different solution to vendoring. So I looked into this now, and it's not easy.\r\n\r\n- `gofmt` itself takes a path (not import paths), and as soon as you give it a directory, you have no way of stopping it from recursively descending all further directories, including /vendor/.\r\n- `gofmt` can take individual .go files, but then I'd need to write a bash loop that iterates over all directories, but doesn't descend into /vendor/, and calls `gofmt -s` on all `.go` files it finds.\r\n- `go fmt`, a higher level command available in `go` binary, takes import paths, so `go fmt (go list ./... | grep -v /vendor/)` could be done to skip /vendor/. But it's not configurable, and defaults to writing to disk, listing files that were affected, and not actually displaying the diff, which makes it hard to see in failed CI output what the gofmt problem was.\r\n\r\nI don't want to spend time writing that custom loop logic in bash, so the best long term solution I think is to create a small custom Go command that performs the needed logic (skipping vendor directories). (Or find an existing command that does what's needed, if that's faster/easier.) But, I don't have a budget to work on that for this PR, so that leaves me with these 2 options:\r\n\r\n1. Avoid `-s` flag and use plain `gofmt`. It will run on vendored directories, which will make tests pass for now, but might cause a failure in the future if a vendored dependency is added that is not compatible with `gofmt`.\r\n2. Close this PR because I don't have the resources to implement all the work needed to get it to merge-able state.\r\n\r\n@shazow How would you like to proceed?"

I was having a conundrum with that bit.  Initially I wanted to see if it was possible to have a user option that could enable/disable timestamps.  If the user entered /ts for example, it would trigger a boolean. Anyway it only partially worked because the prompts are sent in a different manner than the messages, and I absolutely needed both of these to have it.\r\n\r\nAh well... back to the drawing board.

        "body": "To recap some feedback: This is largely considered out of scope for this repo of ssh-chat, but if it's implemented in a nice unobtrusive way then we may consider it for merging. :)\r\n\r\n1. Easiest way to do it quick & hacky (**will not be merged, but fine for your own fork**): Prepend `time.Now()` to each line that gets sent to the user's screen: https://github.com/shazow/ssh-chat/blob/50001bf1727c8ec7fcfc3ae78ab66a125016d13e/chat/message/user.go#L170\r\n2. A more comprehensive way to do it (**not likely to be merged**, but open for debate): Use [`message.Message.Timestamp()`](https://github.com/shazow/ssh-chat/blob/50001bf1727c8ec7fcfc3ae78ab66a125016d13e/chat/message/message.go#L14) as a timestamp for each message, and render it as part of a theme. Would need to add a `theme.ColorTimestamp(...)` function to properly colorize the message segment. Then we could add a theme option whether to render timestamps at all, this would be configured per-user. If disabled, then `theme.ColorTimestamp(...)` would simply return an empty string. Optional: Also change the user Prompt every minute to keep self-sent messages timestamped. Would need to rewrite where the prompt is set which might be a fair bit of work.\r\n3. A more ergonomic approach that is fairly likely to be merged: Anytime a message is sent after some amount of inactivity (e.g. 30min or 1hr), emit the current timestamp as a system message just before relaying the message. This can be done in a very unobtrusive way, and give people a general idea of when messages were sent without polluting the chat too much. It would be configured server-side."

Then I ran `dep ensure` to clone the dependencies to `vendor/` and ran the build again, which ran successfully.\r\n\r\nI prefer the dependencies to be listed in a file like with `Gopkg.toml` because it's a nice and easy way of adding/removing deps as need be instead of depending on Git submodules.

The prompt can be updated without this function, but the update will not be visible on the client side. For example, if one begins typing at 15:00 and then hits enter at 15:01, the message would be still be stamped with 15:00. Since it's updated on the server side, however, it appears correctly as 15:01 to all other users. Unless there is another way to update the client prompt, an implementation of Option 2 is probably not reasonable for the main repo."

I've seen no evidence in my logs that they're trying to issue commands using the exec subsystem.\r\n\r\nMy guess is that most crawlers are trying to break into ssh servers only to log the success somewhere until the operator comes back later to look around. That's why you get root joining for a moment and immediately leaving, then often hours later you'll get someone coming in and doing `ls` etc.\r\n\r\n(Closing for now as I don't have plans to work on this, but we can continue discussing.)"

Since ssh-chat is a server, it can only tell the client to do things.\r\n\r\nMany terminals support playing a \"ding\" when an BEL character is sent. ssh-chat already does this when you receive a DM or your name is mentioned. You just need to use a compatible terminal and enable the feature there.\r\n\r\nThere is no support for multiple rooms.

Then ` ssh-chat ` work normally. Now because I prefer using dropbear instead of openssh (because of a certain error in it ).

Maybe worse than a random port if you add port knocking, obfuscate scan results, or other trickery that is available and maintained outside of ssh-chat.\r\n\r\n>  If someone wants to go through the process of using tor nodes to break in then they deserve to see whatever I'm talking about because \"dam\" that's some devotion.\r\n\r\nIt's something any off-the-shelf ssh crawler bot has been capable of doing for decades, out of the box. No devotion required.

        "body": "Since we did a bunch of changes to how we render things in the last release, we probably broke most bots. I'd like to provide a more barebones output for bots for the next release.\r\n\r\nMy current thinking:\r\n- I'd like to avoid putting this into the exec field (`ssh chat.shazow.net /bot` or whatever`) because I want to reserve this functionality for other things in the future (e.g. choosing which room to join, if we have rooms).\r\n- I'd like to have an in-chat `/bot` command to toggle bot-mode which will remove all formatting and escape codes. Ideally all the bot will see is ASCII with \\r\\n between messages.\r\n- In general, we want to support enabling/disabling features based on what TERM is set. For example, there are terminals out there that support image-inlining, would be a cool future feature to detect that.\r\n- TERM=dumb is a thing too, which seems to indicate support for a handful of escape codes, but we'd like to avoid using these so I'm not sure that makes more sense here.\r\n- I'm still landing on TERM=bot as the API. Yes, there is a risk that somebody someday might write a terminal called `bot` for some reason and decide to break all compatibility with things that rely on the `xterm-256color` TERM value like curses-based apps. But I think that's a risk we can take? Worst case, users of that terminal can do `TERM=xterm-256color ssh chat.shazow.net` if they really wanna override it.\r\n- When no PTY is allocated (e.g. when piping, or using `ssh -T`), the TERM value is not sent. In this scenario, the server will default it to TERM=bot. You can still override this behaviour by sending the TERM value explicitly `TERM=foo ssh -o SendEnv=TERM` if for example you want to pipe but you also want to use the normal mode.\r\n- Bonus points: Make ssh-chat work with rlwrap out of the box? (#226)\r\n\r\nMy only concern right now is whether it'll be too hard to do the mid-session `/bot` toggle, if the implementation strategy will be to bypass the readline/terminal lib altogether in bot mode. We'd be transferring ownership of the io between two implementations which might prove annoying."
