The only thing that bothers me about it is loading twitter's widget external javascript. I wanted to try to load as few external deps as possible to keep this quick and light. But either way the option should definitely be there.\n\nIf you'd like, feel free to take a crack at this and send in a pull request - the code is fairly simple and there are build and contribution instructions in the readme. If not, I'll see about getting this in sometime this week.\n\nEdit: Twitter's script is [quite heavy](http://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js)...\n"

I tested and there are no issues in chrome that I can see, so it might be something specific to your computer. Have you tried opening it in a clean install of chrome, in an incognito window?\n\n**2. Can you add the many buttons**\nI'm not sure I could make any sense of this request, perhaps there's a different way you could word this?\n\n**3. Could you make the menu appear vertically?**\nNo, but if you would like to fork it and modify the styles to have the menu appear vertically, you are welcome to do so.\n"

If you define a set of universal ul styles, there's not much we can do to prevent it from leaking in, other than attempting to clear any other style on it.\n\nThat being said, I have seen leaking ul and li styles in peoples' implementations, and I wonder if there is a simple way to resolve this that doesnt make the semantics suffer. I mean technically I think the best way to handle it would be to remove ul and li and make everything divs, as more or less nobody would define universal div styles.

[Teach a man to fish](http://www.quotationspage.com/quote/2279.html) etc - you know the deal. Happy to help with css questions and such, hit me [on twitter](http://twitter.com/jescalan) and I can try to send you down the right path if you're stuck.\n\nI'm going to close this issue since it's not a problem with share-button, but happy to continue discussing here if you have related questions or followups - only closing to keep the issues section focused on things that are actively being worked on for this project.\n"

Judging by your comments above, in which you don't totally understand how to apply styles to a particular element, I would have to assume that your understanding of CSS is at the little to nothing level.\n\nWhile I could tell you how to fix this problem on your page, the second you need to make another change in the CSS, you will immediately be stuck because you don't know CSS at all. The reason I suggested the resources above is because by building even a basic understanding of CSS, you would be able to figure out how to resolve this yourself, which is awesome - you're learning, you're moving forwards, and you are working on something you get, instead of shoving a bunch of different pieces together and preying that they will work.\n\nThat being said, here's the fix to your issue. Remove the line you pointed out that applies box sizing to everything  (it's in `demo.css` right near the top) and replace it with this:\n\n``` css\n.header-container {\n  -webkit-box-sizing: border-box;\n  -moz-box-sizing: border-box;\n  box-sizing: border-box;\n  padding: 0;\n  margin: 0;\n}\n```\n\n**But** that's the last question I'll answer until you at least make an attempt to learn and understand what you're doing. Because code is awesome, and learning is important.\n"

        "body": "Hey Luca,\n\nI agree with your evaluation in general, let me address it point by point:\n1. The reason I load the entire font rather than a stripped down version is _customization_. You can customize both the text on the button and the icon used to the left if you want. Because of this, if I stripped the font to just those letters and only that icon, you lose the ability to change things if you want.\n2. This is not feasible without again killing customization options. Since you get to choose the class, colors, etc. on your share button, this info is rendered dynamically into the stylesheet, which means that it needs to be touched by JS before render. For this reason, it's processed through a javascript function that makes sure the classes, colors, etc, are all correct at runtime then injected inline. If you want to see the styles, you can just [look at the source](https://github.com/carrot/share-button/blob/master/src/styles.styl), or use the inspector in your browser of choice to see what classes are on the element as you usually would - I don't think it would make it any easier to have them in a separate stylesheet, and it certainly would not make it faster.\n\nSo I guess what I would say overall is that while you are correct that making the changes you mentioned would make the button lighter (although certainly not more modular), it would also kill all the flexibility built in and only allow you to use the button in it's default state or face some weird issues.\n\nThat being said, I don't think that's such a bad thing. I think most people do use it in it's default state -- I certainly do -- and I think it would be a great idea to make a third build of the button that was as slim and inflexible as possible for the situations where you need that. As kyle mentioned above, if you do want to take a stab at this and submit a pull request that would be awesome, and we would be very likely to accept it. I would just say rather than overwriting the button as it exists now, have it built out to an alternate from the cakefile so we can offer it as an option :grinning: .\n"

Using this in Bootstrap, I ended up pulling out all the css so I could minify it with everything else, changing the sprite font to fontawesome, and removing Lato altogether.  l also removed the facebook app_id requirement and script injection because I already had it on the page (mostly to minimize the code further as you did check for it, but I think the FB popup should check for window.FB instead of config.app_id... in case it is already setup on the page).\nAlso I made my version check for \"data-title\", \"data-text\", \"data-image\", etc. type element attributes to fill in the config variables... Makes for some understandable markup.\nSorry no push request, as I worked directly on the JS, and css.\n"

        "body": "Hey @canadiannomad -- I'm not sure if you read my lengthy response as to why the css can't be pulled out without sacrificing flex, but a detailed reason why I can't accept an overwriting PR with separated css is written above. That being said, I am planning on releasing a third build that is inflexible and slimmer, presenting only the default options and allowing the opportunity to separate css if you want. This will be landing in the next week or two : )\n\nAs for the FB popup checking, this functionality is covered, the reason it checks `app_id` is because it will set up facebook for you if it ins't already initialized, as [seen here](https://github.com/carrot/share-button/blob/master/src/share.coffee#L50), which it needs the `app_id` for. In addition, you might not want to share attached to the app that you have initialized, so rather than forcing that it seems better to me to give users the option to choose whether they do want to do this. Because of the way the logic works, if you already have facebook initialized with an app, you can just pass `true` to the `app_id` param as a confirmation that you do want to share from that app, and everything should work fine. Assuming that any page that has facebook set up wants to share from that app though, I think would be assuming too much.\n\nAs far as the `data-x` attributes, I really don't like that pattern. I like keeping javascript in javascript, and html in html. This keeps both clean. Shoving data attributes and extra classes all over your html makes it messy and difficult to read, and un-separates your concerns, making things less modular, which is against the [unix philosophy](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_philosophy) that I try to follow strongly in all my projects (same reason I don't like bootstrap, which puts your css into your html, and angular, which puts javascript in your html). So while I fully support you adding this in your fork, I don't see the data attribute checking as likely to show up in our version.\n\nOverall, thanks for sharing your changes and it was interesting to read through how you made them -- always great to have feedback on the process. Will keep all this in mind working on the future of share-button :grinning: \n"

Similarly I find it just as weird to change string variables in combined, minimized CDNed javascript instead of the PHP outputted HTML where I have easier abilities to change things without affecting caching... I guess I just like to keep my JS static.\n"

Bootstrap works in much the same way - it provides some base styles and if you need to change them you override them, not go into the source and change the original ones.\n\nBut you certainly have a point in that the way that this plugin manages css is unconventional. Rather than giving you a stylesheet and saying use this, find the values you want to change, and change them if you want, it automates the changes and stylesheet injection through JS. I understand if this is something people aren't comfortable with and am planning on pushing a release in the next week that operates in a more conventional manner that can be used as an option for people that prefer it :grinning: \n"

Therefore, it works on our live example page, but not on your domains or locally, because you are still binding to the carrot facebook app id.\n\nInstructions for setting up the plugin on your own can be found [here](https://github.com/carrot/share-button#setup). Following these steps will yield better results. To solve that specific issue, if you remove the `app_id` line from the options passed to the plugin, it should resolve correctly.\n"

Removing the hide animation doesn't help with this (I tried), it has to do with the fact that the markup is on the page unstyled, then gets injected and the icons load. The hide call is an attempt to at least get the unstyled markup hidden until things have loaded, but we can still get a flash occasionally.\n\nIf it is really bothering you, in the meantime if you load the script it the `<head>` it should resolve it. We're working on an alternate version as well that has fewer customization options but loads faster and presents a separate stylesheet, when that's out everything will be instant.\n"

        "body": "Yes. I think you are right. I think your proposed solution would be ideal. \nLoad styles in a stylesheet (ideally would be loaded in the head), then the js would be loaded at the end of the page right before the body but could really be loaded anywhere. \nLoading styles in the js is an interesting idea and offers some advantages, but creates issues with rendering and the flicker etc. if you move the JS to the head then you risk slowing down your whole page which is less than idea.\nThe fact that this script relies on the icon font (which is hosted 3rd party website) is actually the biggest problem I have with it. We pick up the speed of not using a 3rd party sharing platform (like AddThis.com or ShareThis.com) but create the exact same problem because we are dependent on the speed of the 3rd party font site for the icons. \nI'd say moving the fonts into the repository (via an open sourced font or image) would be a great solution.\n"

Testing it quickly, it appears as if empty string is a falsey value where if you even set it as a single space, it works. Weird.\n\nAnother issue I found here is that the popup does not auto-center when you change the text. This could be a tough calculation, but should be worked out.\n\nI'll get in a patch for at least the first issue today and report back here.\n"

A couple more things, and this should be ready to merge:\n- Squash those two commits together ([ref](https://github.com/carrot/share-button/blob/master/contributing.md#commit-cleanliness))\n- Could you use present imperative tense for the commit messages? It's what we've been using for all commits in this repo so far, just trying to keep it consistent. So for example, it would be \"center twitter and google+ popups\"\n- Could you rebase this on master? It's not totally caught up to the current head.\n- If you add the words `closes #33` to the bottom of the pull request text, it will auto-close the issue when merged :smile: \n"

Just as a general tip, it's a good idea to use the _title_ of the issue as a short summary of what the problem is, and use the _description_ to add more details on your request.\n\nIt's also a good idea to look through the issues or search the repo using the search bar up top to see if someone has already filed a matching issue. In this case you might have found https://github.com/carrot/share-button/issues/22, which addresses the same thing.\n\nI'm not totally clear on what you mean with the bit.ly link piece, but perhaps you can comment on #22 and add some more feedback there. I'm going to close out this issue though, as it's a duplicate.\n"

Remove the installation instructions commit from this PR, it's part of a separate issue\n2. We prefer commits in present imperative tense, so it would be \"create opengraph and twitter card fallbacks\"\n3. You can actually close out the issue you opened from the commit using `closes #X`, so your commit could read `create opengraph and twitter card fallbacks, closes #61`\n4. Squash the console.log remove commit into the previous commit, just for cleanliness :grinning: \n"

        "body": "This could go with the pull, or it could go with the actual script but I thought I should mention it.\n\nWe need a way to detect clipping and automatically shift to left/right alignment. Here is the problem image:\n\n![clipped](https://f.cloud.github.com/assets/1513378/2363224/9ab026d2-a649-11e3-9b61-383b7855a381.png)\n\nSo when it clips, it should be auto-detected. Personally, I'm running a debounce script from http://unscriptable.com/index.php/2009/03/20/debouncing-javascript-methods/ and tying screen measurements into it but that's just one solution. I have the luxury of knowing the exact pixel range where my project clips, for this you'll need something a bit more universal.\n\nThe obvious resolution though, is to flip to top left in this example, when the issue occurs:\n\n![resolved](https://f.cloud.github.com/assets/1513378/2363244/02e95110-a64a-11e3-9bdd-5fdc260bf6af.png)\n\nThen in mobile views, I do something else entirely:\n\n![mobile-view](https://f.cloud.github.com/assets/1513378/2363249/129340f8-a64a-11e3-922f-4d01b8b995a3.png)\n\nSo again, this should _probably_ be its own issue but since it's magnified by adding the additional two items, it also fits here.\n\nFood for thought.\n"

As we push to add more networks (and more available configuration), I don't expect all networks to follow the same methodology. I feel that pushing for consistency across all networks is a zero-sum game.

People kept using it including, as far as I saw, many major news sites. \n\nA while back, we at Carrot, as a [Facebook Preferred Marketing Developer](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/preferredmarketingdevelopers/), were able to ask Facebook whether or not there was an EOL on the `sharer.php`. We didn't receive an EOL but they did try to discourage us from using it.\n\nThat said, it appears to be back and that's great! The problem that remains, in the context of this plugin, is that it would alter the expected functionality. Per this plugin, users expect to be able to dynamically set the parameters they want to pass to each social network whereas `sharer.php` relies solely on Open Graph tags.\n\nI've added the ability to use the `sharer.php` functionality as I like that it removes the Facebook JS SDK dependency, but it is disabled by default.\n\nSee: https://github.com/carrot/share-button/commit/ec3b825bcb2986b19c719af6ac082566f9f628a4#diff-0730bb7c2e8f9ea2438b52e419dd86c9R73\n\nLet me know what you think!\n"

Then I removed the div again, reloaded and checked, and now I can see it as below:\n\n```\n<div id=\"fb-root\" class=\" fb_reset\">\n  <div style=\"position: absolute; top: -10000px; height: 0px; width: 0px;\">\n    <div><iframe name=\"fb_xdm_frame_http\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\" scrolling=\"no\" id=\"fb_xdm_frame_http\" aria-hidden=\"true\" title=\"Facebook Cross Domain Communication Frame\" tab-index=\"-1\" src=\"http://static.ak.facebook.com/connect/xd_arbiter/wTH8U0osOYl.js?version=40#channel=f3c66f49f&amp;origin=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.murm.io\" style=\"border: none;\"></iframe><iframe name=\"fb_xdm_frame_https\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\" scrolling=\"no\" id=\"fb_xdm_frame_https\" aria-hidden=\"true\" title=\"Facebook Cross Domain Communication Frame\" tab-index=\"-1\" src=\"https://s-static.ak.facebook.com/connect/xd_arbiter/wTH8U0osOYl.js?version=40#channel=f3c66f49f&amp;origin=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.mydomain.com\" style=\"border: none;\"></iframe></div>\n  </div>\n  <div style=\"position: absolute; top: -10000px; height: 0px; width: 0px;\">\n    <div></div>\n  </div>\n</div>\n```\n\nSo with this code in the page my JS stopped working. But even after removing the div node manually from the page, it still doesn't work.\n\n@jenius @tmilewski: I've quickly made the broken version available here, so that you can have a look at it directly: http://www.murm.io.

It **will not work** for any domains other than that one regardless as to whether they are locally hosted or a live site.\n\nRead the both our documentation as well as the Facebook's documentation which may be found at https://developers.facebook.com/.\n\nAlso, please note that the `Cannot call method 'shift' of null` error occurs in `all.js` which is a file that the Facebook JS SDK injects into your HTML. We have zero control over that file.\n\nAfter you've correctly implemented the share per both ours and Facebook's documentation, if you find any errors please open a new issue as you've attached this to a completely unrelated ticket.\n"

Again, this is not an issue with share-button, it's an issue on your site, and we simply don't have time to debug everyone's personal stuff.\n"

If you think you'd like to make changes to this plugin, please do so and we'd be happy to review them. And even if we don't accept them, you can still continue to use your own forked version!\n\nAlso, I can't help but note that while you claim the opposite, you are actually the only one complaining.

Usually the best way to keep blog entries in sync with facebook or twitter is by using a different tool for that purpose. Popular blogging systems like tumblr and wordpress have this functionality built in, but I assume since you are talking about python here you are building one from scratch (any reason not to use something like tumblr? It's fully themeable, has a community and support for a lot of tools for publishing, can support custom domains, and is free). If that is the case, maybe a tool like [networkedblogs](http://www.networkedblogs.com/) would help to auto-publish your posts, assuming you have an rss feed set up.\n\nGood luck!\n"

So I don't see this becoming a feature here specifically, although I do think that would be a nice fork.\n\nThere's also [mojotech's social builder](http://www.mojotech.com/social-builder), crafted lovingly by the amazing @samccone, which I think is closer to fitting the style you're thinking about.\n"

With require (or any other module loader), rather than having everything that's exported attach to window, you manually manage the exports within the scopes you need. This is a good thing, and is how it should be, but it requires a slightly different mindset from the standard drop a script tag and attach everything to window approach.\n"

I just tested it with the exact link that you provided as a string inputting into the description field for email, and it worked perfectly fine. Here's a jsfiddle reproduction:\n\nhttp://jsfiddle.net/58CSA/\n\nIt seems like the issue is likely with the function you are using to generate the link as mentioned earlier, or that there's something else on your site interfering with the way that share button operates. This sounds like a difficult issue, but based on this reproduction I don't think it's an issue with share button.\n"

First of all, I need to have an inline block element, not a div or another block element because this sharing icon is a part of a toolbar. Second, I want this `span` element to be click-active, not the `label` that the plugin is generating. Also I don't want the text \"Share\".\n\nI know it is possible to do all this in CSS but if I have to do that then to be honest I may just as well write my own piece of code for displaying share buttons... which obviously is not a good solution because I want to use existing code whenever I can.\n"

So now that the button has been stripped out, it's just a row of customizable share icons, which is a different project.\n\nYou are welcome to do this if you'd like, but it would be better as a fork than an option in this project, since the button is the entire point :grinning: Thank you for the feedback though, and still very much open to discussion even though I am going to close this issue.\n"

        "body": "Yeah, I see what you are saying for sure. But the entire point of this project is to have it require an additional click. Our general view on this is that if people want to share your page, they will do so, and we trade an additional click for the following benefits: \n- If you have a button that says \"SHARE\" in clear capital letters, it seems counter-intuitive to me that someone would like your content enough to share it, intend to share it by clicking that button, then once they see the networks go \"Shit I have to click again? This is way too much work, fuck it\" and not share the page.\n- A bunch of share buttons on a page is spammy-looking and visually distracting. Compressing them into a button frees up visual real estate on your page and makes it look more elegant and less spammy.\n- When you hide the networks behind a button, you can load the page much quicker, as mentioned previously, and load less of the networks' tracking scripts and other bullshit without the user intending for that to happen.\n\nThese are totally opinions backed by zero research at all. If someone did research on this, it would be awesome, I'd be interested to see the result. But with all that being said, using this library is a trade-off -- one some people are willing to make and others are not. For those who are not, they typically choose not to use this library. But we are, which is why we made and use it.\n"

Within your config object you are listing the networks outside of the `networks object`, which causes share-button to not apply those. Also your grid that you're using is hiding the share-buttons, because of overflow. In my fiddle I have changed the flyout to `top right` so you can see them all working.\n"

For more infos see this [blog post](http://substack.net/task_automation_with_npm_run) for more infos.\n\nAbout build sources, if you don't want to add build folder to your main repo, the bower component should point to a shim version of the project, as jquery component points [here](https://github.com/components/jquery), but I think you have already addressed this problem.  \n\nThx for the support and congrats for the project!\n"

If you provide more code I can dig further into the issue though.\n\nAlright to touch on your points:\n\n> pass dom node as an element to ShareButton\n> use any html element with some predefined class\n\nNo longer needed because Custom Tags have been available since HTML 4 and act like standard `div` when styling. With more recent technology, like Web components, you can now **render** [x-tags](http://www.html5rocks.com/en/tutorials/webcomponents/customelements/) in javascript. With that in mind, share-button is **not** a web component because browser support. With that in mind, you're able to create custom elements with react or web components. Because share-button isn't a web component, all you need to do when you display `share-button` is to instantiate `new ShareButton(opts)`.\n\n> use custom html in share button (in case someone wants to use some other icon or multiple icons for example and or whatever)\n\nIn share-button we create all the icons in our [styles file](https://github.com/carrot/share-button/blob/master/src/share-button.styl). This full customization of the button without having to touch any html. We no longer use the Entypo font icon set because we can render all of the icons as background images.\n"

What I did is I serve a blank page with only the meta headers if the user agent hitting the url is facebook's and if not the normal page. \n\nThe blank page only contains this (with handlbars markup): \n\n```\n<html>\n    <head>\n        {{#with data}}\n          <meta name=\"author\" content=\"{{metaAuthor}}\"/>\n          <meta property=\"og:url\"           content=\"{{metaUrl}}\" />\n          <meta property=\"og:type\"          content=\"website\" />\n          <meta property=\"og:title\"         content=\"{{metaTitle}} wrote\" />\n          <meta property=\"og:site_name\" content=\"WriteDown\"/>\n          <meta property=\"fb:app_id\" content=\"439874298\"/>\n          <meta property=\"og:description\"   content=\"{{metaDescription}}\" />\n          <meta property=\"og:image\"         content=\"{{host}}/images/logo.png\" />\n         {{/with}}\n    </head>\n    <body>\n\n    </body>\n</html>\n```\n\nthis is the only way to get facebook to share the correct data because unlike the rest of the networks when you press the button it crawls the page. \n\nyou also need to use this format for multiple buttons:\n\n```\nnetworks: {\n    facebook: { before:function(element) { this.url=element.getAttribute('data-url'); }\n```\n"

        "body": "Just to chime in; in share-button's current state we've added the ability for users to integrate the button in various ways and allow a lot more customization than previous versions. Regarding how lightweight share-button is, well that's left to one's opinion. I do agree that it's current state isn't the lightest, but some people will consider jquery to be light and that's [pretty big](https://mathiasbynens.be/demo/jquery-size). Tho in the end we have trade-offs, the reason we jumped in size so much between  `v0.5.0` & `v1.0.3` is due to the switch from `coffeescript` & `babel`, this is due to everything that goes into transpiling. If you wanted the lighter version, I'd recommend going with `v0.5.0`, but be aware that it comes with the downside of less customization. In the future I'd like to have the ability to have a couple options for building share-button, like no polyfills or removal of collision-detection, these were features that the community requested, but not everybody uses them. In the end if you want to cut down on everything, you have the ability to customize the button and completely remove `lato`, you just need to clone it down and compile your changes :smile: \n\nHere's the size comparisons between `v1.0.3` & `v0.5.0`\n\n| v1.0.3 | size |\n| --- | --- |\n| share-button.css | 31.2 KB |\n| share-button.js | 65 KB |\n| share-button.min.css | 30.1 KB |\n| share-button.min.js | 29.2 KB |\n\n| v0.5.0 | size |\n| --- | --- |\n| share.js | 20.6 KB |\n| share.min.js | 15.2 KB |\n"

        "body": "I have the same issue. On Chrome 50, and IE - icons are invisible.\n\nSo here's a workaround that I did. I [took the SVG images from the repo](https://github.com/carrot/share-button/tree/master/src/svg), I added a second version of each (example: pinterest-light.svg) that's the same, but white (with fill=\"white\") and finally I overrode the messed-up plugin styles - updating the background-image with the external SVGs that I placed in my project `/img/share-button` directory. Here's an example.\n\n``` css\nshare-button .sb-social li[class*='pinterest']:after {\n    background-image: url('/img/share-button/pinterest.svg');\n}\nshare-button .sb-social li[class*='pinterest']:before {\n    background-image: url('/img/share-button/pinterest-light.svg');\n}\n```\n\nSo I did this steps for all icons that I needed. It works on Chrome, Firefox, Safari and IE latest. The only issue is that it 'costs' a few additional server (http) requests. But I guess, this is still better then not working at all :)\n\nAnd here's my full fix. Download the zip: [share-button-svgs.zip](https://github.com/carrot/share-button/files/232357/share-button-svgs.zip) and extract it in your images directory. Than paste this styles in your project stylesheet, making sure the url on your side is correct.\n\n``` css\n/**\n * Solves the issues with SVG as a background image,\n * that doesn't display on Chrome 50 and IE latest.\n * This way it works on Chrome, Firefox, Safari and IE latest.\n *\n * https://github.com/carrot/share-button/issues/301\n */\nshare-button .sb-social li[class*='pinterest']:after {\n    background-image: url('/img/share-button/pinterest.svg');\n}\nshare-button .sb-social li[class*='pinterest']:before {\n    background-image: url('/img/share-button/pinterest-light.svg');\n}\n\nshare-button .sb-social li[class*='twitter']:after {\n    background-image: url('/img/share-button/twitter.svg');\n}\n\nshare-button .sb-social li[class*='twitter']:before {\n    background-image: url('/img/share-button/twitter-light.svg');\n}\n\nshare-button .sb-social li[class*='facebook']:after {\n    background-image: url('/img/share-button/facebook.svg');\n}\nshare-button .sb-social li[class*='facebook']:before {\n    background-image: url('/img/share-button/facebook-light.svg');\n}\n\nshare-button .sb-social li[class*='googlePlus']:after {\n    background-image: url('/img/share-button/googlePlus.svg');\n}\nshare-button .sb-social li[class*='googlePlus']:before {\n    background-image: url('/img/share-button/googlePlus-light.svg');\n}\n\nshare-button .sb-social li[class*='email']:after {\n    background-image: url('/img/share-button/email.svg');\n}\nshare-button .sb-social li[class*='email']:before {\n    background-image: url('/img/share-button/email-light.svg');\n}\n\nshare-button .sb-social li[class*='linkedin']:after {\n    background-image: url('/img/share-button/linkedin.svg');\n}\nshare-button .sb-social li[class*='linkedin']:before {\n    background-image: url('/img/share-button/linkedin-light.svg');\n}\n```\n"

I regretfully must inform you and the community that this project is no longer being maintained. Shortly after this post is public you will see that the description has been updated with a note stating that this project is now unmaintained. Someday I'd like to imagine this project would become relevant to us and comeback to life. Once again I apologize for the lack of maintenance, communication and love towards this project and the community.\n\nUntil the revival of this project - live long and prosper.\n"
