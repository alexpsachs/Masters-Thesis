        "body": "Hi kbala,\n\nThe preferred way to handle clicks on views would be to implement an AbsLayoutContainer.OnItemClickListener.  The click listener will call receive a call back when an item is clicked providing both the parent FreeFlowContainer and the FreeFlowItem proxy for the view that was clicked.  Inside the proxy should be all of the information you would need for building your intent (the data object and a reference to the view).\n\nYou could also set the click listener in your sectioned adapter.  Just be sure to reset it on the recycled views.  Be aware, there are more pitfalls this way.\n\nLet me know if you need more information than this.\n\nRick\n"
