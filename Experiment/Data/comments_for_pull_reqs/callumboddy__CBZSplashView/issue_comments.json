        "body": "So, the first issue I came across is: How to handle the current implementation?\n\nI think the current implementation is useful by itself, and could be used, so I won't be replacing it. I am, however, seeing two possible approaches:\n\n1) Add a new init method that takes a `UIBezierPath`, and save the bezier path.\n\nThe issue here is, everywhere in the code, we have to add if statements. Check if we are using the bezier path, then do this, otherwise do nothing. Same thing for the image.\n\nHere is an example:\n\n``` objc\n- (void)drawRect:(CGRect)rect\n{\n  /* Only override draw rect for vectorized splash screen */\n  if (!self.bezierPath) {\n    return [super drawRect:rect];\n  }\n\n  CGContextRef context = UIGraphicsGetCurrentContext();\n  CGContextAddRect(context, self.bounds);\n  CGContextAddPath(context, self.bezierPath.CGPath);\n\n  [self.backgroundViewColor setFill];\n  CGContextEOFillPath(context);\n}\n```\n\n2) Provide an abstract superclass interface, and have different implementations in two subclasses.\n\nI think this is a better approach, since it modularly separates the two functionalities. We should also hide those classes from the user, and provide a convenient \"factory\" method, since the user doesn't need to worry about the exact subclass he is using.\n\nFrom this, I realized there will be some major overhauls to the component, but it will be hidden within the component.\n\nMaz\n"

        "body": "On my app, the icon is appearing in the centre of the view *inside* the Navigation Controller. I believe that this is happening in your case as well. The offset is the height of your navigationController.\r\n\r\nI don't know how to fix it, if anyone can help, please do. Thank you!\r\n\r\nEDIT: Solved it by adding the splashView as a subview of the Window and not my main view. Try it and let me know if it fixes your problem:\r\n\r\n```swift\r\nif let appDel = UIApplication.shared.delegate as? AppDelegate {\r\n\tappDel.window?.addSubview(splashView)\r\n\tsplashView.startAnimation()\r\n}\r\n```"
