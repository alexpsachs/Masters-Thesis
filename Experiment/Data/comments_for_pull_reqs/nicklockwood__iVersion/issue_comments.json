I just changed your code for now to say \"New\nversion available!\" as the title, so it's all on one line. I also added\nanother \\n to the view so it will be bigger.

        "body": "I've identified the problem. I missed the critical detail that this bug was specific to iOS 4.x and Xcode 4.4 (LLVM 4.0). I apologise for not paying closer attention to your bug report.\n\nThe issue appears to be that as of LLVM 4.0, the + (void)load method now fires before ARCLite has fully loaded. I've kept the load method but deferred setup until the main runloop has started, and this fixes the crash.\n\nThanks for reporting this, and sorry again for not investigating it properly until now. The fix is included in version 1.9.7.\n"

I opened that URL directly on my phone just by tapping the link from github in Safari and it worked correctly, so the problem is not inside iVersion.\n\nTry using the following code. It should fix the problem, although I'm still not sure why you're having the problem in the first place:\n\n```\n+ (void)initialize\n{\n    [iVersion sharedInstance].updateURL=[NSURL URLWithString:@\"itms-apps://itunes.apple.com/app/id353599677\"];\n}\n```\n"

Sometimes I don't remember to update the remote plist details for every release and would like it to just revert to App Store details instead of showing a blank change log. I think this is the case most of the time for developers with multiple apps, multiple releases, it's sometimes hard to keep track of remembering which plists were updated / changed at the right times.\n\nFor the second fix:\nSay the user is on 0.9 and in the app store it has 1.0. In your remote plist if you have entries for 1.0 and 1.1 release messages to prepare for the release, 1.1 details won't show to the user unless 1.1 is in the app store.\n"

        "body": "Damn. Excellent blog post, and I agree with the conclusion.\n\nTo be clear:\n\n1) I don't think that iVersion violates the letter or spirit of the App Store guidelines. What Apple is trying to avoid is the use of frameworks like Sparkle that actually download and install code outside of the App Store sandbox, or might lure people to download a non-App Store version of the App in the guise of an update.\n\n2) I don't advise trying to sneak stuff past the Apple reviewers, or deliberately breaking the rules and trying to get away with it. The rules are there to keep users safe, and they are (mostly) quite reasonable.\n\nBut yeah, less is more when it comes to explaining your app to the reviewers. I would suggest a policy of waiting for them to ask rather than volunteering information (I've submitted Mac apps with the network permission without explanation before - most apps require network access for analytics, etc and I don't think they normally question it).\n\nIn future it might be a good idea to include some other network-related feature such as an online help page or about screen, or another library such as iRate that is easier to explain to an overworked Apple reviewer :-)\n"

If you find that's not the case, that's a bug and I'll fix it.\n\nIf you include the entry but leave it blank then you'll get an alert without release notes, but again, that's by design (maybe you don't want to display the release notes).\n\nI could add a preferences for this, and I'll consider it. But generally I try to avoid adding features unless they are absolutely necessary because I want the library to be as simple to use as possible, and each extra option makes it more complicated to understand and use.\n\nWith regard to your second fix, that is how it's supposed to work, and I thought it worked that way already. I'll check - thanks for the heads up.\n"

I misunderstood this, I thought remoteVersionsPlist would completely override iTunes. \r\n\r\nYes it **did** work as I thought it would when I ran this with a debug app. This app was a dummy inhouse app just for testing, aka enterprise app with a different bundle id, obviously not existing in iTunes or even iTunes Connect. This app would always fail to find itself on iTunes and always fall back to the remoteVersionsPlist which let us control finely what version to require.\r\nThe iTunes API version has still to update itself for iPhones, granted we've only been waiting around 12 hours yet.\r\n"
