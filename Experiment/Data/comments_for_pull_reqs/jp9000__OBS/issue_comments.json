This could definitely be messing with things potentially..\n\nThe red segment may end up getting used depending on how high the microphone boost is set. In the case the samples can get scaled over 1, the red meter will end up being used. \n\nOn the meter, I will continue to try to adjust the scaling on the meter. I have definitely seen meters like the one referenced, and I tried to implement a similar scale but it looked worse than what is committed. I might have been doing something incorrectly though. I will try again to implement a similar scale. The response delay might be several issues one it could be that I am only taking 2 samples as you pointed out. The other might be that the low pass filter might need some tweaking. I will look at this tonight and see if I can tell what is going on. \n\nI really like this project and I want to help you guys out. Thanks for the feedback!\n"

        "body": "Yeah, it is kind of weird. I just realized that Audacity (an open source audio program) has an interesting way of doing the visualization. They show a bright bar for the RMS value, then it is followed by a darker bar for the max + a 3 second persistent peak indicator. Of course there is a huge debate going between them about switching over to just the peak value with color bands:\nhttp://wiki.audacityteam.org/wiki/Talk:Proposal_Improvement_of_Meter_Toolbar_UI \n\nThe one thing that I think RMS is good for is getting the relative volume of the desktop and microphone right. Coming from using XSplit before, this always seemed to be really hard to do. But the peaks are important too, the more I look into it the more I realize how many variations there are out there. I am fine with switching to just peaks, let me know what you think.\n"

Balancing different sources is a legitimate use for it though.\nIf RMS is important to keep, here's something I proposed on IRC:\n\nhttp://img33.imageshack.us/img33/5172/meterq.png\n\nThe RMS is dark green, and the peak is a gradient between that and light green. It allows you to use the information that RMS gives you without distracting from the important peak reading.\n\nAlso, in the current implementation there are two things that irk me: one is that the background is a darker green/yellow/red, which is distracting imho-- it should just be dark grey. The other is that yellow seems to serve no real purpose. In any normal recording the meter is going to be yellow most of the time, yet that shouldn't be any cause for concern as the sample range for yellow is not even close to clipping. Anything that is \"business as usual\" should be green. I would propose a very small yellow range, and reserve red for true clipping only.\n\nAnother thing is that stereo meters might be useful.\n"

Your visualization mufunyo is interesting, fiddling with the actual colors used will not be hard once I get the peak indicator working correctly. So once I get all the different levels working I should be able to whip up different visualizations w/o much issue. I will post those here for feedback.  \n\nIf we are going to show both the RMS and the peak, then having the different green/yellow/red colors will probably just muddle things up, so I will probably use the same hue color with varying brightness as both your mock-up and audacity use. Will probably still use red as an indicator if clipping is occurring.\n\nI'm going to have to come back to this in a couple of days, and it sounds like there is going to be an issue potentially merging with some of the buffer code that Jim is working on. So we'll see where we are in a couple days. \n\nThanks!\n"

Lots of people have requested audio levels as well.\n\nAbout what Audacity does, I didn't download it myself and tried to figure out what exactly it is that it does based on the Wiki Talk comments, but I couldn't really figure it out conclusively. Reading what you said, Bill, it's probably along the same lines as what I had in mind (only they use two solid colours and I suggested a gradient). In any case, I'm looking forward to seeing your proposal. :)\n"

I understand about the volume controls, its an understandable issue. \n\nI updated the meters so that they show both the peak and rms simultaneously as is done in audacity. I implemented the meters with both the solid bars and with the gradients like mufunyo suggested. Here's videos of both in action:\n\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pciUSm3mP9M&feature=youtu.be\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SzlAMZjpOFA&feature=youtu.be\n\nI think the gradient is nice aesthetically, and you kind of get a sense of where the RMS is. On the other hand with the solid bars the RMS and peaks can be both be seen fairly clearly. The imprecision of the gradient might not be a problem since we're not even labeling the dB ticks or anything. \n\nLet me know what you guys think :)\n"

If you do say a 20-frame delay with threading or something you could make the call asynchronous and give the encoder all the time it needs to encode the frame.  The encode function is designed to be asynchronous like that.\n"

Sorry if I understood something wrong.\nMy first thinking was to disable the selection completely while the source is disabled, resizing/moving would not be possible through the preview, only through shortcuts or the menu. But this would be bad for the people that often move stuff around while they have it disabled. I personally think its necessary to see the source to resize and align it correctly, unless its a fullscreen source.\nAt the same time I would guess that its better to have the aspect lock active at all times (active or disabled source), unless you hold shift. This seems consistent and how else should you resize a disabled source without stretching it by mistake? If you want to keep a custom aspect ratio, you probably also have something you want to align it to. So you would take this as a guide and just use shift to resize your source.\n"

I suppose the point is moot if the other slower presets are included, but they're more meant for lower resolutions.  I didn't really see any benefit added from slower even at lower resolutions, and I figured if someone really needed the preset, they could just type the preset manually as an x264 command.\n\nI know my reasoning probably isn't the best, but what do you think?\n"

My custom parser was meant to be a bit more like HJSON rather than JSON, but it should parse regular JSON just fine as well.\n"

It allows me to wire OBS into services like Brightcove where the stream URL and/or key rotates every 30 seconds (it allows them to manage capacity on the servers but makes it awkward for OBS users since they need to get their stream started quickly).\n"

If you need to make a change to an earlier commit, you can use the interactive rebase and use 'edit' to edit the contents of that commit and/or its message.  When complete, force push your new fixes, and it will update the pull request and your commits on it.\n\nIf you made a change that you want to merge in to an earlier commit, interactive rebase can also do that with the 'fixup' command.  When doing the interactive rebase, place the offending commit that you wish to squash below the commit that you wish to squash it in to, and label it as 'fixup'.\n\nAlso, if you are not experienced with this and need help, let us know on the dev chat.  It's perfectly okay to not be experienced with git, just let us know and we'll help best we can.  #obs-dev on quakenet is the IRC channel if you need help with it.\n"

Commit 8bfdd25 does this.\n\nThe issue that is happening is obs is not coping over your original scenes.xconfig to sceneCollection because the folder already has files. It only copies it over when the folder is empty. I hope you have a backup of your original scenes.xconfig just copy and paste it and overwrite the scenes.xconfig in  the sceneCollection folder. This issue only effects people that already have scene collections in the sceneCollections folder before commit 8bfdd25 was made .\n\n\"In general, wouldn't it be better if the import button would allow you to choose a file from which we could import the global sources?\" \nI thought of that but it got to complicated to code(I'll look into it a little more). \n\nI think it would be easier to understand if scenes.xconfig when obs copies it renames it to Main.xconfig since for new users it will be their first scene collection and for existing  users it will have their original scenes.xconfig contents. \n"

Pretty old kind of import style.\n\nI also want to say thanks a lot for your work so far. Please always take my comments as constructive feedback!
