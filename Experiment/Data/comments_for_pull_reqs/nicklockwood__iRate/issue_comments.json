There are several other methods in the library that would crash if you called them from the background, so I'm not sure why this one should be singled out.\n\nI think it's generally good practice to assume that no method is thread safe unless it specifies otherwise. Nothing in the iRate documentation says that it's a good idea to call promptForRating from the background.\n\nIf you need to call it from a background thread, just use performSelectorOnMainThread from your own code.\n"

The Finder displays localized bundle names based on the current language settings. Other applications can request your application\u2019s localized name as well and display it as appropriate.\n> \n> **Note: Mac OS X does not support localized names for non-bundled applications.**\n> You specify localized names for your application using the existing bundle localization mechanism. The Resources folder of your application bundle contains one or more language-specific resource directories. (See \u201cBundle Structures\u201d in Bundle Programming Guide for information about bundle resource directories.) In each of these language-specific directories, you can include an InfoPlist.strings file with a list of localized property-list keys. One of the keys you can include in this file is the CFBundleDisplayName key, whose value you can set to the localized name of your bundle.\n> \n> At all times, Mac OS X prefers user-customized display names over the default and localized names you specify in your bundle. If the on-disk application name is different than the non-localized version of your bundle display name\u2014that is, the name associated with the CFBundleDisplayName key in your Info.plist file\u2014the system assumes the user made the change and returns the customized name. If at some later time, the user changes the application name back to the original name, the system reverts to using the localized values from your application bundle.\n> \n> Important: If you want your localized display names to appear, you must include the LSHasLocalizedDisplayName key in your application\u2019s Info.plist file, set the type of its value to Boolean, and set the value to true. The functions that access localized display name information check for the existence of this key before retrieving the information.\n\nProbably checking `LSHasLocalizedDisplayName` for YES is an option before querying the BundleDisplayName. Or check if nil/empty and fall back to the BundleName.\n"

        "body": "Hi Mic,\n\nHere's how I see it:\n\nMy aim with the library is to make it as useful as possible to a wide audience, but avoid adding features that only apply to one user, or where it will improve the library for a few users at the cost of the majority.\n\nYour aim should be to use the main fork if possible, or persuade me to make changes to the library to support your needs if it doesn't already do so, and only as a last resort should you fork it because even with github's excellent merging, that's still making more work for yourself, risking introducing bugs, and losing the benefits of me supporting issues you have in future.\n\nIt doesn't sound like your problem is particularly unique, but the solution of disabling the foreground event is obviously not something I could ever merge into the trunk. A better solution might be to do as you suggest and add a flag to ignore foreground events, which could then be a feature I could merge back in, but before doing that, let's just analyse your problem at bit more:\n\nThere are three way to trigger a prompt at the moment: 1) number of launches/foreground events, 2) number of days, 3) number of user-defined events.\n\nCriteria 1 and 2 must both be met to trigger a prompt. Criterion 3 is independent (it will trigger a prompt even if 1 and 2 have not been met).\n\nThe aim of these options is to defer the prompt until the user has used your app for a long enough time to have developed an informed an opinion about it (preferably a positive one). For a typical app like a game, this period is about 10 days assuming they use it at least once a day, which is why the uses and days both default to 10.\n\nThe reason why I treat foreground events as a use is because app launches are a very poor metric for interaction on modern iPhones because an app may stay running for days at a time but be opened and closed multiple times during that period. This is equally true for your app - cold launches tell you nothing about how much users are interacting with your app.\n\nOn the other hand, foreground events are quite a good metric for how much people are using your app. A user who installs the app, runs it a few times but then never really interacts with it won't generate any foreground events. A user who does use it properly will presumably frequently change tracks and so generate a lot of foreground events - more than most users of most apps.\n\nSo it seems to me that the best option is to do exactly what you said in option 2; Leave the days parameter at the default of 10, and set the uses parameter to something much higher than normal, say 100. That way users will only be prompted if they have had the app installed for at least 10 days and have used it a reasonable amount during that time.\n\nAlternatively you could ignore the days and uses completely (by setting them both to a very high number) and log an event whenever the user plays a track, or whatever other metric makes sense for your app, and then prompt the user after they've played 100 tracks (or whatever).\n\nNick\n"

I use the device locale for the app store country by default because the vast majority of users use the app in the same country they bought it, and there's no way to find out the actual app store country programmatically.\n\nYour app is not available to buy in Australia, so it's reasonable to assume that the number of users with your app in Australia is essentially zero (other than yourself, obviously, but you're the developer).\n\nI don't really see this as a problem because when the app is released it won't cause a significant number of missed ratings, however if it bothers you, you can set the following code:\n\n[iRate sharedInstance].appStoreCountry = @\"PK\";\n\nWhich will force the app to always check the Pakistan app store.\n\nNick\n"

Can you do a couple of experiments for me?\n\n1) Try building your app with Xcode 4.3.3 or earlier, and see if it works correctly on 10.6.8\n\n2) Try building the app using progressively earlier versions of iRate until you find one that works.

If you check the release notes you will see that this issue was fixed a while ago, but I appreciate it's easy to miss that. For what it's worth, this bug was introduced by Apple in Xcode 4.4 and did not happen under Xcode 4.3, so I fixed it as soon as I could have - it wasn't a case of the previous release of the library not working with ARC under iOS 4 and me simply not bothering to test it or mention it in the docs. Unfortunately I have no way to notify users of bugs or updates.\n\n@Tibbs Thanks for the support, I appreciate it.\n"

        "body": "Hi Nick,\n\nThe debug output was showing me the correct bundle and app id's, and the url it reports in the first debug line works if I run it in safari; I get the expected json back, etc. Confusing as to why it would then fail. \n\nYes, apps are in the app store.\n\nI did some more testing, and was eventually able to get it working by deriving the url, and setting that on the shared instance, and then NOT setting either the appID or the applicationBundleID. I'm doing all iRate customization in the app delegates' initialize method, as advised. I'm thinking I probably won't need to do any of this in the production build; I'm just trying to determine whether that's true or not. \n\nI didn't try using just the applicationID or the applicationBundleID; perhaps that would make a difference? Like I said, right now, using just the url works as expected. I'll try more permutations and get back to you with results. \n\nAlso, does the previewMode flag impact any of this? If so, how? It doesn't seem to using just the url; the only thing it does seem to affect is the count tracking; it'll present the prompt always, etc. \n\nThanks for getting back so quick. Your library's quite useful; thanks for sharing it with us. \n"

Here's the code for that:\n\n```\nif (!self.isFromCallSheet) {\n    DLog(@\"Prior to iRate logging event, we have %d number of recorded log events, and %d number of uses\", [iRate sharedInstance].eventCount, [iRate sharedInstance].usesCount);\n    [[iRate sharedInstance] logEvent:NO];\n    if ([[iRate sharedInstance] shouldPromptForRating]) {\n        DLog(@\"After recording one, and prior to prompt, we have %d number of recorded log events, and %d number of uses\", [iRate sharedInstance].eventCount, [iRate sharedInstance].usesCount);\n        [[iRate sharedInstance] promptIfNetworkAvailable];\n    }\n}\n```\n\nIt prompts on the very first event, indicated by this log output:\n\n```\n2012-10-05 10:46:01.001 DoddlePro[12579:907] -[ContactUnifiedViewController setupView] Prior to iRate logging event, we have 0 number of recorded log events, and 1 number of uses\n2012-10-05 10:46:01.150 DoddlePro[12579:907] -[ContactUnifiedViewController setupView] After recording one, and prior to prompt, we have 1 number of recorded log events, and 1 number of uses\n```\n\nSo, the shouldPromptForRating is incorrectly returning YES\n\n**Update:** sorry for being so dense. I looked at the comments on the eventsUntilPrompt again, and now it makes sense. I changed my usesUntilPrompt to 2, and now I get the behavior I'm looking for. Thought I might leave this in in case it helps somebody else; I'll leave it to you to wack it if you feel it's not appropriate. Thanks again for all your assistance, Nick. \n"

I thought about it a little and i definitely think it was better before.\n\nThere are many examples of mixed languages in interfaces: if the app uses twitter/facebook sharing from iOS, it's going to appear localized. If it uses iOS stock buttons, they're going to appear localized. No matter what language the app is showing.\n\nSo basically, iRate should use whatever iOS is using. But i guess there's no API for that, and in that case, the old implementation at least gave the same results as if there was one API.\n"

You don't even need to include iRate.h anywhere.  The iRate class is added to the runtime by compiling iRate.m into the project.\nThis is easily verified by setting a breakpoint in the iRate init code.\n\nBut maybe this is a bit fancy, and recommending [iRate sharedInstance].previewMode = NO as the minimal configuration would be a bit less nervewracking.\n"

        "body": "Hi Nick,\n\nI understand your rationale, but please keep in mind that there are very valid reasons to support manual memory management (and saying it's crazy just shows a deep lack of understanding).\n\nIn our case, we're using iRate as part of our internal library which we use across all our applications. Since some of them haven't been ported to ARC yet (and some of them probably never will), enabling ARC for iRate.m in all of them would be a lot of work, because you have to do that manually for every target in every project. By adding support for building without ARC we can continue updating our internal library automatically without requiring manual changes to every project which uses it.\n\nI'm also sure that there are still lots of iRate users which haven't had the opportunity or the interest (porting a \"finished\" app which is only on maintenance mode to ARC requires significant work in exchange for, literally, zero benefits) to port their code to ARC, but would like to use newer versions of iRate. By removing support for non-ARC you're preventing those users from upgrading. In the case of complex code bases - where keeping the source code both ARC and non-ARC compatible requires lots of work -, I would understand dropping support for non-ARC, but iRate only requires 3 calls to release. It's not like the code is going to be \"less pure\" or \"dirty\" by doing manual memory management. In fact, there are already two calls to CFRelease() in a  very error-prone idiom in openAppPageWhenAppStoreLaunched() which could have been replaced by a bridge_transfer cast.\n\nIf would be nice if you could reconsider your decision to merge this patch.\n\nThanks,\nAlberto\n"

The real problem is calculating with floats and returning doubles, or whichever way around it is. Or returning an integer when your return type is a BOOL.\n\nThat link you provided suggests using -Wextra as well. Perhaps then you'd see some of the warnings above? Not sure.\n\nAnyway, feel free to close this request. It makes sense to choose something and stick to it. Besides, the code I submitted is by my own definition pretty smelly.

You can fix that by setting the app ID explicitly, but that isn't necessary. Enable preview mode if you'd like to see what it will look like before you submit.\n"

You can fix that by setting the app ID explicitly, but that isn't necessary.

Run app with en localization - app will use correct localization as it's supported.\n2. Switch iPhone language to fr - app will use correct localization as it's supported..\n3.Switch iPhone to any not supported language - app will use the **last** (in our example fr) used supported language.\n\nSo to get worked en localization for en-GB you should switch iPhone to en localization first and then switch to en-GB and you'll get english text.\n\nTry to check this scenario. If it's reproducible for your then it's not iRate bug, it's Apple's feature :smile: \n"

So it makes code a little cleaner imo. And in this case I can just to make these methods public in my fork and not to worry each time on update of iRate if there were some updates in these parts :)\n\nPlease, let me know if you don't want change in `h` file here, but ok with changes in `m` file. I will update PR then.\nThanks in advance!\n"

That is where the sender requirement comes in.  In the past we have faked the argument.  However this hack does not work with the static registrar.  It is more strict about the signatures matching.  \n\nFor the time being, I am using my fork of this library for a source to generate the binding.  I would like to delete that fork.\n"

        "body": "Thanks for your quick reply.\n\nThe first compiler warning (weak property unpredictably set to nil) is controlled by the \"Sending messages to __weak pointers\" build setting under Apple LLVM 5.0 - Warnings - Objective C and ARC. This was a warning Apple added recently as an extra precaution to prevent edge cases where you're in a method and the object being sent the message is deallocated because nothing was pointing to it strongly. While in many cases you don't need to worry about this, Apple suggests implementing the pattern I included in the previous comment as a best practice.\n\nThe second compiler warning (multiple methods named 'length' found) is controlled by the \"Strict Selector Matching\" build setting under Apple LLVM 5.0 - Warnings - Objective C. For this one, the warning exists to make sure you are sending a given message to an instance of the right class. And if there are multiple classes that implement a method of the same name, the compiler may get confused when trying to find the correct method implementation. It's also helpful for code readability.\n\nThanks again for responding to this issue. Let me know if you have any other questions.\n"

I believe the code should look this way:\n\n```\n        if (self.firstUsed)\n        {\n            if ([[NSDate date] timeIntervalSinceDate:self.firstUsed] >= self.daysUntilPrompt * SECONDS_IN_A_DAY))\n            {\n                //if was previously installed, but we haven't yet prompted for a rating\n                //don't reset, but make sure it won't rate for a day at least\n                self.firstUsed = [[NSDate date] dateByAddingTimeInterval:(self.daysUntilPrompt - 1) * -SECONDS_IN_A_DAY];\n            }\n        }\n        else\n        {\n            //reset defaults\n            [defaults setObject:[NSDate date] forKey:iRateFirstUsedKey];\n            [defaults setInteger:0 forKey:iRateUseCountKey];\n            [defaults setInteger:0 forKey:iRateEventCountKey];\n            [defaults setObject:nil forKey:iRateLastRemindedKey];\n        }\n        [defaults synchronize];\n```\n1. The else is now executed even when the time check isn't satisfied, which is wrong. It should only be executed when first used (sorry, I haven't noticed this one before).\n2. You use < in the date check in the if but I believe it should be >. Are you sure about this? (It's 2AM here, I may be wrong, but this is also the way it was in my original patch.)\n3. Why do you use +1 in the if condition? I don't quite understand. The if should be the same like the one checking whether it's time to rate now. If it's not time to rate now, no problem.\n4. There should be -1 in the following, not +1 (you move back from now by one less day than daysUntilPrompt so the next day it will be daysUntilPrompt and the alert will pop up):\n   \n   ```\n   self.firstUsed = [[NSDate date] dateByAddingTimeInterval:(self.daysUntilPrompt - 1) * -SECONDS_IN_A_DAY];\n   ```\n5. Just one minor thing I have noticed is that since you update defaults in any case now, [defaults synchronize] should be moved out of the else block behind it. But this really isn't a big problem - you could actually skip the synchronize calls completely as iOS calls synchronize for you automatically (it's useful just in the case the app crashes before).\n"

        "body": "Hi, you're partly right. Th problem with your patch was that you never reset the logic once the app is updated, which meant that the promptForNewVersionIfUserRated would always prompt the day after they install the new version, which isn't what I wanted.\n\nMy fix didn't work correctly, but that's what it was trying to achieve.\n\nI believe I've now implemented this correctly. To be honest I need some unit tests around this because it's way too complex to test manually, but it's not really structured in a way that makes it easy to automate.\n\nAnyway, to address a couple of your points:\n\n3) Why do you use +1 in the if condition? I don't quite understand. The if should be the same like the one checking whether it's time to rate now. If it's not time to rate now, no problem.\n\nIf the user had installed the app daysUntilPrompt -  1 second ago, then your logic wouldn't reset the time, so potentially they might still be notified the same day (e.g. if the closed and reopened the app and the time was now daysUntilPrompt + a few seconds). By subtracting an extra day, I avoid that issue.\n\n5) Just one minor thing I have noticed is that since you update defaults in any case now, [defaults synchronize] should be moved out of the else block behind it.

        "body": "Hello Nick, thanks for the explanation, I wasn't aware of the promptForNewVersionIfUserRated knob (there are really lots of settings which can conflict with the code). Wouldn't it be safer to use [self ratedAnyVersion] for the reset check instead of [self ratedVersion:lastUsedVersion]?\n\nI understand what you mean why you added the +1, but there should be -1 I'm afraid. Have a look at the current code:\n\n```\n        else if ([[NSDate date] timeIntervalSinceDate:self.firstUsed] > (self.daysUntilPrompt + 1) * SECONDS_IN_A_DAY)\n        {\n            //if was previously installed, but we haven't yet prompted for a rating\n            //don't reset, but make sure it won't rate for a day at least\n            self.firstUsed = [[NSDate date] dateByAddingTimeInterval:(self.daysUntilPrompt + 1) * -SECONDS_IN_A_DAY];\n        }\n```\n\nThe else condition will be true one day after self.daysUntilPrompt and it won't prevent the rating window from appearing. Also if you set self.firstUsed with the +1 value, it will make the rating popup appear immediately because it's set to more than self.daysUntilPrompt days to the past.\n"

If your device (or the simulator) is set to US locale then it will use that - I expect that's why it wasn't working correctly for you.\n\nIf you want to hard-code the locale however, you can do so by putting the following in your App Delegate - there's no need to modify the iRate library:\n\n```\n+ (void)initialize\n{\n    [iRate sharedInstance].appStoreCountry = @\"gb\";\n}\n```\n"

Perhaps it doesn't like being paused or put into the background?\n\nThe best way to replicate it is probably to try showing an alert at random times after startup in your app and seeing what happens and/or to report this bug to Apple and see what they say (although they'll probably need a simple project that reproduces the issue to be able to do anything - as would I)\n"

Couple of notes from that thread.\n\n> Apple support confirmed with us that there is a bug on 32 bit devices running iOS 8.x that may cause a crash if a MapView (or other OpenGL context) is updated while the app is in the background.\n\nand from an Apple employee\n\n> But either way this is an Apple Bug to fix, the workaround itself is fairly heavyweight (assuming it works, which I'm not certain of).\n\nand then directly after that\n\n> Looks like Apple has fixed the issue and I don't see it anymore in iOS 8.3\n"

I probably locked iRate below 12 in order to avoid the iOS 10.3+ way of opening the in-app rate alert (I don't remember the reason for this, but hey).\r\n\r\nIn my app I had two cases where I used iRate.\r\n\r\n1. When you do an in-app action enough times, the alert \"wanna rate?\" popped up.\r\n2. In the options menu, I had an extra option \"rate now\" which directed the user to the app store review page, so the user could rate easily at any time.\r\n\r\nNow, the `iRate.sharedInstance().openRatingsPageInAppStore()` is still broken for iOS 11.0 users.\r\nHowever `iRate.sharedInstance().promptIfNetworkAvailable()` will work, if we accept the 10.3 in our app. I guess that should be the proper way since iOS 10.3 anyway and we just have to live with it.\r\n\r\nSo at this point, I assume that for me, 1 should work if I use the latest iRate, and 2 will work if use `iRate.sharedInstance().promptIfNetworkAvailable()` instead of `iRate.sharedInstance().openRatingsPageInAppStore()` which won't work on iOS 11.0."

I thought twice and thrice and I guess case 2 above is a no-go since iOS 11.0 (or probably also since 10.3, in a way).\r\n\r\nFirst, it doesn't make sense to prompt the user in the same way in 2 as I do in 1, I'd want to open the review page below 10.3 and open the in-app SKStoreReviewController from 10.3 and up. However with the current iRate there is no way to do that, unless possibly if we fix it so we can call `[self promptForRating: NO];`.\r\n\r\nBut the discussion doesn't end there because on iOS 10.3+ that would ultimately call https://developer.apple.com/documentation/storekit/skstorereviewcontroller/2851536-requestreview which, as is stated in the docs, might or might not open the review UI. Which is in terms with how Apple wants the review experience to work...\r\n\r\nI guess I will have to advocate to my director to remove case 2 and only use case 1 above - rate upon some rare user interaction.\r\n\r\nAlso in the long run I guess Apple is specifically wanting to shoot down iRate and similar libraries that show review popups."
